Ses01F_impro01_F000 Excuse me.
Ses01F_impro01_F001 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro01_F002 Is there a problem?
Ses01F_impro01_F005 Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.
Ses01F_impro01_F012 That's out of control.
Ses01F_impro01_F014 Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?
Ses01F_impro02_F000 Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
Ses01F_impro02_F001 Yeah.  I know.
Ses01F_impro02_F002 I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...
Ses01F_impro02_F003 I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.
Ses01F_impro02_F004 There's people that have given more though, you know?
Ses01F_impro02_F005 I know.
Ses01F_impro02_F006 There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.
Ses01F_impro02_F008 Just, you know, kicking myself.
Ses01F_impro02_F010 things just aren't what they seem.
Ses01F_impro02_F012 If not me then, who?
Ses01F_impro02_F013 You'll videotape everything, yeah?
Ses01F_impro02_F014 Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?
Ses01F_impro02_F015 Last month--  Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_F016 I have to find sitters.
Ses01F_impro02_F017 We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.
Ses01F_impro02_F018 And your mother is close by.
Ses01F_impro02_F019 I'll send you lots of letters.
Ses01F_impro02_F020 And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.
Ses01F_impro03_F000 Well Vegas was awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_F001 And, um, I got married.
Ses01F_impro03_F002 Yeah.  In the old town part.
Ses01F_impro03_F004 Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_F005 It was at the slot machines.
Ses01F_impro03_F006 Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.
Ses01F_impro03_F008 Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.
Ses01F_impro03_F009 But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.
Ses01F_impro03_F010 Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
Ses01F_impro03_F012 Oh.  Totally.
Ses01F_impro03_F013 I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_F015 Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now
Ses01F_impro03_F016 He likes to keep tabs, you know.
Ses01F_impro03_F017 Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Ses01F_impro03_F018 Penny slots. That's what he plays.
Ses01F_impro03_F019 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F021 Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-
Ses01F_impro03_F022 Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro03_F023 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F024 Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
Ses01F_impro03_F025 We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.
Ses01F_impro03_F026 She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro04_F000 Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?
Ses01F_impro04_F001 I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.
Ses01F_impro04_F005 He just...
Ses01F_impro04_F006 you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.
Ses01F_impro04_F009 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_F013 I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.
Ses01F_impro04_F014 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_F028 I'm not frustrated.
Ses01F_impro04_F029 Who do you think you are?
Ses01F_impro04_F030 You are so high and mighty.  I just--
Ses01F_impro04_F031 Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.
Ses01F_impro04_F032 The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.
Ses01F_impro04_F033 I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.
Ses01F_impro05_F008 Flight seven fourteen.
Ses01F_impro05_F009 Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?
Ses01F_impro05_F011 Is this a joke?
Ses01F_impro05_F012 Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.
Ses01F_impro05_F014 You're kidding me, this is a joke.
Ses01F_impro05_F015 Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.
Ses01F_impro05_F016 We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.
Ses01F_impro05_F017 I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.
Ses01F_impro05_F018 Do you understand who my husband is?
Ses01F_impro05_F019 If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.
Ses01F_impro05_F020 Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?
Ses01F_impro05_F021 You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.
Ses01F_impro05_F022 Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?
Ses01F_impro05_F023 Because I probably know him.
Ses01F_impro05_F024 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_F025 I don't want money, I want my clothes.
Ses01F_impro05_F026 What's your name?
Ses01F_impro05_F028 Okay.  I'll do that.
Ses01F_impro05_F029 I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.
Ses01F_impro05_F030 A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.
Ses01F_impro06_F002 No.
Ses01F_impro06_F003 That's sweet.
Ses01F_impro06_F004 Thank you.
Ses01F_impro06_F005 I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.
Ses01F_impro06_F006 I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.
Ses01F_impro06_F007 So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.
Ses01F_impro06_F008 So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-
Ses01F_impro06_F009 this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.
Ses01F_impro06_F010 Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.
Ses01F_impro06_F011 And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.
Ses01F_impro06_F012 I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.
Ses01F_impro06_F013 I don't know.
Ses01F_impro06_F014 At the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_F015 couple hours.
Ses01F_impro06_F016 I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.
Ses01F_impro06_F018 Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.
Ses01F_impro06_F019 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F020 It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.
Ses01F_impro06_F021 My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.
Ses01F_impro06_F022 She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.
Ses01F_impro06_F023 Umm. Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F024 And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...
Ses01F_impro06_F025 But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.
Ses01F_impro06_F026 Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-
Ses01F_impro06_F027 There's another one, I can't remember.
Ses01F_impro06_F028 I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?
Ses01F_impro07_F000 Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know.
Ses01F_impro07_F002 I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.
Ses01F_impro07_F003 Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.
Ses01F_impro07_F004 I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.
Ses01F_impro07_F005 I know. We should throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_F009 Yeah.  I'm not sure.
Ses01F_impro07_F010 Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro07_F012 So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.
Ses01F_impro07_F013 I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.
Ses01F_impro07_F016 I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.
Ses01F_script01_1_F005 He's dreaming of him again, walking around.
Ses01F_script01_1_F015 Well I got an idea, but what's your story?
Ses01F_script01_1_F034 Just give it some more thought.
Ses01F_script01_1_F035 What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_F037 You have a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_F038 Oh.  Must you be inspired?
Ses01F_script01_1_F041 All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.
Ses01F_script01_1_F042 Just don't think like that.
Ses01F_script01_2_F003 He's not going to marry her.
Ses01F_script01_2_F004 It's got that about it.
Ses01F_script01_2_F005 What is going on here, Joe?
Ses01F_script01_2_F006 She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses01F_script01_2_F007 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.
Ses01F_script01_2_F008 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.
Ses01F_script01_2_F009 Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses01F_script01_2_F010 I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.
Ses01F_script01_2_F011 I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses01F_script01_2_F012 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.
Ses01F_script01_2_F013 Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.
Ses01F_script01_3_F000 You're the only one who still loves his parents.
Ses01F_script01_3_F001 It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
Ses01F_script01_3_F002 [BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses01F_script01_3_F003 I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.
Ses01F_script01_3_F004 For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.
Ses01F_script01_3_F005 And then, you.  You've been kind of...
Ses01F_script01_3_F006 Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.
Ses01F_script01_3_F007 I knew they would.
Ses01F_script01_3_F008 Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?
Ses01F_script01_3_F009 I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.
Ses01F_script01_3_F010 [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script01_3_F011 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_F012 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_F013 No. No
Ses01F_script01_3_F014 Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.
Ses01F_script01_3_F015 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses01F_script01_3_F016 You started to write me.
Ses01F_script01_3_F017 Every day since.
Ses01F_script01_3_F019 beating around the bush.
Ses01F_script01_3_F020 I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.
Ses01F_script01_3_F021 Not like that you're not.
Ses01F_script01_3_F022 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.
Ses01F_script01_3_F028 Yeah, sure.
Ses01F_script01_3_F029 How many?
Ses01F_script01_3_F030 Aw, geez.
Ses01F_script01_3_F031 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_script01_3_F035 What would I do with a fortune?
Ses01F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses01F_script02_1_F004 That's not your flashlight.
Ses01F_script02_1_F006 You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.
Ses01F_script02_1_F007 How's that supposed to make me feel?
Ses01F_script02_1_F008 Yeah.
Ses01F_script02_1_F009 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script02_1_F010 I'm cold.
Ses01F_script02_1_F015 Not particularly.
Ses01F_script02_1_F024 That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_1_F025 About what?
Ses01F_script02_2_F000 That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_2_F001 About what?
Ses01F_script02_2_F006 Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses01F_script02_2_F008 For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.
Ses01F_script02_2_F009 Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?
Ses01F_script02_2_F010 Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.
Ses01F_script02_2_F015 I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.
Ses01F_script02_2_F016 For God's sake, this is not about fish.
Ses01F_script02_2_F017 Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.
Ses01F_script02_2_F019 You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses01F_script02_2_F022 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses01F_script02_2_F023 No.
Ses01F_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses01F_script02_2_F034 I know you are Augie, I know.
Ses01F_script02_2_F035 I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.
Ses01F_script02_2_F036 I didn't say that.
Ses01F_script02_2_F040 You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.
Ses01F_script02_2_F041 So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.
Ses01F_script02_2_F042 Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.
Ses01F_script02_2_F043 Augie, you bought refreshments.
Ses01F_script02_2_F044 I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses01F_script02_2_F045 I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.
Ses01F_script02_2_F046 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses01F_script02_2_F047 Or not.
Ses01F_script03_1_F005 [LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses01F_script03_1_F006 We'll behave exquisitely.
Ses01F_script03_1_F007 I think I shall do a curtsy.
Ses01F_script03_1_F010 Yes.  Meaning just that.
Ses01F_script03_1_F011 Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.
Ses01F_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses01F_script03_1_F020 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_F021 Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses01F_script03_1_F022 Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.
Ses01F_script03_1_F024 Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses01F_script03_1_F029 The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses01F_script03_1_F030 [LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_2_F000 And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_2_F001 Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01F_script03_2_F002 Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.
Ses01F_script03_2_F004 I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses01F_script03_2_F005 Well, what of it?
Ses01F_script03_2_F013 Don't be stupid.
Ses01F_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses01F_script03_2_F015 No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses01F_script03_2_F016 Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.
Ses01F_script03_2_F017 No it isn't.
Ses01F_script03_2_F018 You shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F021 They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
Ses01F_script03_2_F022 Yes I did, quite a lot.
Ses01F_script03_2_F023 Mind your own business.
Ses01F_script03_2_F024 You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.
Ses01F_script03_2_F025 You've always had a weak head.
Ses01F_script03_2_F026 On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses01F_script03_2_F027 Oh shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F028 Shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F029 Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.
Ses01F_script03_2_F030 Why?
Ses01F_script03_2_F031 There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses01F_script03_2_F032 They are away in Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_F034 Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses01F_script03_2_F035 You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.
Ses01F_script03_2_F036 I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses01F_script03_2_F037 Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses01F_script03_2_F038 This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
Ses01F_script03_2_F039 Oh.  Yes I am.
Ses01F_script03_2_F040 Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.
Ses01M_impro01_F000 Next.
Ses01M_impro01_F001 My window is open.
Ses01M_impro01_F007 No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.
Ses01M_impro01_F008 It's really simple if you have a problem with it... Maybe you should--
Ses01M_impro01_F011 What do you expect me to do?
Ses01M_impro01_F012 Probably.
Ses01M_impro01_F019 Don't raise your voice with me.
Ses01M_impro01_F020 Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
Ses01M_impro01_F021 Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?
Ses01M_impro01_F022 Maybe you never been to the D.M.V. before, maybe you should get back in line.  You know what?  sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one.
Ses01M_impro01_F024 Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.
Ses01M_impro01_F025 They don't pay me enough to deal people like you.
Ses01M_impro02_F000 What's happening?
Ses01M_impro02_F009 I don't even know what to tell you.
Ses01M_impro02_F010 What about the birthday party?
Ses01M_impro02_F013 You're going with the same ones?
Ses01M_impro02_F015 It's not the same though.
Ses01M_impro02_F017 Mm hmm.  We'll build a bunker and never come out.
Ses01M_impro02_F019 Don't say that.
Ses01M_impro03_F002 Why?
Ses01M_impro03_F003 Is she on the run?
Ses01M_impro03_F004 Oh, she just needs to marry you.
Ses01M_impro03_F005 That's incredible. That's awesome. Where's she from?  Maybe you can get a dual citizenship.
Ses01M_impro03_F006 That's so cool. Uh huh.
Ses01M_impro03_F007 [LAUGHTER] Why did she pick you? Where were you?
Ses01M_impro03_F008 You were at a party? And she's like hey. You seem unattached she's like.
Ses01M_impro03_F009 That's unbelievable... Yeah.

Ses01M_impro04_F002 What do you mean?
Ses01M_impro04_F003 There's a lot of people looking for jobs.
Ses01M_impro04_F004 I don't know, I mean, I just don't think...
Ses01M_impro04_F005 Did you ever think it might be your attitude that's...
Ses01M_impro04_F006 I don't know just sometimes you get kind of... No, I'm not saying that.  I just--
Ses01M_impro04_F007 ...has anyone ever just said anything like that to you before?
Ses01M_impro04_F008 Right, sure.
Ses01M_impro04_F009 But I mean you kind of got to, you got to fake it 'til you feel it, right?
Ses01M_impro04_F010 I'm just saying that if I was looking to hire somebody in the--or kind of... No. No. No.
Ses01M_impro04_F011 No.  I'm just saying though that if I was a person who was hiring somebody I-- --would not hire someone who was angry or upset.
Ses01M_impro04_F012 No.
Ses01M_impro04_F013 Well, you know a little.  If you were to listen to--
Ses01M_impro04_F014 I just don't want you to fly off the handle.
Ses01M_impro04_F015 You kind of have a short fuse.
Ses01M_impro04_F016 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro04_F017 Like this, right now we're trying have a conversation.
Ses01M_impro04_F018 We're trying to have a conversation and you seem extremely hostile. You keep cutting me off.
Ses01M_impro04_F019 I can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in...
Ses01M_impro04_F020 ...and you're always right.
Ses01M_impro04_F021 You have an excuse for everything.
Ses01M_impro04_F022 I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.
Ses01M_impro04_F023 [BREATHING]
Ses01M_impro04_F025 Well, what kind of field are you looking to go into?
Ses01M_impro05_F000 Can I help you?
Ses01M_impro05_F001 I need a little more information.
Ses01M_impro05_F002 What- What flight did you come in on?
Ses01M_impro05_F003 Georgia?
Ses01M_impro05_F004 There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir.
Ses01M_impro05_F005 I've been college educated.
Ses01M_impro05_F006 I speak your language.
Ses01M_impro05_F007 I'm just saying you don't need to talk to me like I-
Ses01M_impro05_F011 Details, Details.  Well, anyhow can I--
Ses01M_impro05_F012 so you flew in from Atlanta...

Ses01M_impro05_F015 I wouldn't let you?   I was not in Atlanta. I was not in Atlanta.
Ses01M_impro05_F016 I had nothing to do with the boarding attendance.  I'm sorry that your seat was wherever it was.
Ses01M_impro05_F017 I have some unfortunate news, uh, that your bag isn't going to be--
Ses01M_impro05_F018 --arriving any time soon.
Ses01M_impro05_F019 I'm really sorry to tell you this but...
Ses01M_impro05_F020 It's not.  I can offer you fifty dollars and a reimbursement gift cards for our airline...
Ses01M_impro05_F021 ...and your future...
Ses01M_impro05_F022 No.
Ses01M_impro05_F023 Yes.
Ses01M_impro05_F024 We've actually...
Ses01M_impro05_F025 They do as matter of fact.  We don't like to publicize it because
Ses01M_impro05_F026 people wouldn't Fly our airline.
Ses01M_impro05_F027 What was that?
Ses01M_impro05_F028 That's unfortunate.
Ses01M_impro05_F029 That's too bad.
Ses01M_impro05_F030 I wish I could give it to you.
Ses01M_impro05_F031 I wish I-
Ses01M_impro05_F032 That's not - no.
Ses01M_impro05_F033 No.
Ses01M_impro05_F034 We have plenty of aggressive searching going on it's not there.  Someone's taken it.
Ses01M_impro06_F000 You okay?
Ses01M_impro06_F001 What's happened?
Ses01M_impro06_F002 You don't have to if you don't want to.
Ses01M_impro06_F003 I'm sorry to hear that.
Ses01M_impro06_F004 You've been taking care of it all?
Ses01M_impro06_F005 Oh Jesus.
Ses01M_impro06_F006 He sick for awhile?
Ses01M_impro06_F007 Was it an accident?
Ses01M_impro06_F008 how was sick?
Ses01M_impro06_F009 Well, I'm confused.  He was sick or it was an accident?
Ses01M_impro06_F010 Oh. Really fast? Oh.
Ses01M_impro06_F011 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro06_F012 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro06_F013 Totally, yeah.
Ses01M_impro06_F014 Mmhmm.
Ses01M_impro06_F015 Lock
Ses01M_impro06_F016 Mmhmm.
Ses01M_impro06_F017 The plans you make [GARBAGE].
Ses01M_impro06_F018 It leaves a hole for you too.
Ses01M_impro06_F019 It leaves a hole for you too, in your plans together.
Ses01M_impro06_F020 It gets better.
Ses01M_impro06_F021 Mmhmm.
Ses01M_impro06_F022 MMhmm.
Ses01M_impro06_F023 Mmhmm.
Ses01M_impro06_F024 How long did you know each other?
Ses01M_impro06_F025 That's a long time.
Ses01M_impro06_F026 It's good that you were there.
Ses01M_impro06_F027 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro06_F028 Are there things you wish you'd done differently?
Ses01M_impro07_F000 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro07_F001 [LAUGHTER]. For softball? That's unbelievable. Is it slow pitch?
Ses01M_impro07_F003 Pinch hitting softball.
Ses01M_impro07_F004 That is incredible.
Ses01M_impro07_F005 That's amazing. They pay for everything?
Ses01M_impro07_F006 Your housing, books, everything? That is incredible.
Ses01M_impro07_F007 That is incredible. Do you get like a per diem?
Ses01M_impro07_F008 You should...You should look into that.
Ses01M_impro07_F009 That is amazing, congratulations. Good for you.
Ses01M_impro07_F010 Oh.
Ses01M_impro07_F011 Yeah, that you probably. You should see one of these Victorian houses around by.
Ses01M_impro07_F012 Oh. Venice beach.
Ses01M_impro07_F013 Oh, you don't like that. You're west-sider?
Ses01M_impro07_F014 Okay. That would be way too much of a commute you can't do that. Especially- I know especially from--I don't know, what I was going to say, I don't know.
Ses01M_impro07_F015 I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.
Ses01M_impro07_F016 Oh yeah. He'd drop you right off at practice?
Ses01M_impro07_F018 They have those neon--softballs.  They're like day-glow you can see them anywhere.
Ses01M_impro07_F020 Oh. That is incredible. Is it--
Ses01M_impro07_F021 do they have a--is it a co-ed softball team?  I mean... Really? You know, I didn't even know that they have that.
Ses01M_impro07_F022 Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?
Ses01M_impro07_F023 That is unbelievable.
Ses01M_impro07_F024 I would put that right up there with--ping-pong.
Ses01M_impro07_F025 I mean not to denigrate what you are doing.  I think that's great.
Ses01M_impro07_F026 No, no.  I love softball. I played softball all the time.
Ses01M_impro07_F027 I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.
Ses01M_impro07_F033 You're like the rookie? The new kid.
Ses01M_impro07_F034 Just watch in five years you'll be like on the force. You carry around donuts in your back pocket... [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses01M_script01_1_F005 Cried hard?
Ses01M_script01_1_F006 [BREATHING]
Ses01M_script01_1_F008 He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.
Ses01M_script01_1_F011 What do you mean a mistake?
Ses01M_script01_1_F014 What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?
Ses01M_script01_1_F015 To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?
Ses01M_script01_1_F016 The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--
Ses01M_script01_1_F017 Why?
Ses01M_script01_1_F020 Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.
Ses01M_script01_1_F023 I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_F024 From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_1_F025 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F026 Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses01M_script01_1_F029 I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses01M_script01_1_F030 That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.
Ses01M_script01_1_F031 He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.
Ses01M_script01_1_F032 Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.
Ses01M_script01_1_F035 Are you crazy?
Ses01M_script01_1_F036 You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?
Ses01M_script01_1_F037 Oh, must you be inspired.
Ses01M_script01_1_F039 Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F040 All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.
Ses01M_script01_1_F041 Well, you don't think like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F042 I don't understand you, do I?
Ses01M_script01_1_F043 Well, I can see that.
Ses01M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses01M_script01_2_F001 It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses01M_script01_2_F004 What is going on here, Joe?
Ses01M_script01_2_F005 The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.
Ses01M_script01_2_F009 I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses01M_script01_2_F011 Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.
Ses01M_script01_2_F012 Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.
Ses01M_script01_2_F013 You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.
Ses01M_script01_3_F000 The only one I know still love his parents.
Ses01M_script01_3_F001 Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.
Ses01M_script01_3_F003 Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.
Ses01M_script01_3_F004 For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.
Ses01M_script01_3_F005 [BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...
Ses01M_script01_3_F006 You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.
Ses01M_script01_3_F008 From her point of view why else would I come?
Ses01M_script01_3_F012 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses01M_script01_3_F014 Everyday since.
Ses01M_script01_3_F015 Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_F016 I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses01M_script01_3_F018 Chris, what's the matter?
Ses01M_script01_3_F019 No, what is it?  Is your mother?
Ses01M_script01_3_F021 You got to tell me.
Ses01M_script01_3_F022 Wouldn't work like this.
Ses01M_script01_3_F023 Yeah, sure.
Ses01M_script01_3_F024 How many?
Ses01M_script01_3_F025 [BREATHING]. Geez.
Ses01M_script01_3_F026 Do you still feel that way?
Ses01M_script01_3_F030 What would I do with a fortune?
Ses01M_script02_1_F005 You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?
Ses01M_script02_1_F007 No.
Ses01M_script02_1_F008 I'm fine.
Ses01M_script02_1_F009 I wonder if they can hear me talk
Ses01M_script02_1_F014 Then let's go.
Ses01M_script02_1_F017 Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.
Ses01M_script02_1_F021 Yes.
Ses01M_script02_1_F022 Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.
Ses01M_script02_1_F023 We didn't see them the year before either.
Ses01M_script02_2_F000 That's the wind.
Ses01M_script02_2_F010 Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.
Ses01M_script02_2_F011 I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses01M_script02_2_F013 Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?
Ses01M_script02_2_F014 Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.
Ses01M_script02_2_F015 No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.
Ses01M_script02_2_F016 I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.
Ses01M_script02_2_F019 Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.
Ses01M_script02_2_F022 And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses01M_script02_2_F024 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses01M_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses01M_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses01M_script02_2_F030 I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
Ses01M_script02_2_F031 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses01M_script02_2_F032 Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.
Ses01M_script02_2_F033 This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.
Ses01M_script02_2_F034 This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?
Ses01M_script02_2_F035 I know that Augie, I really do.
Ses01M_script02_2_F036 I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.
Ses01M_script02_2_F037 I didn't say that.
Ses01M_script02_2_F040 You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.
Ses01M_script02_2_F044 I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses01M_script02_2_F045 I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.
Ses01M_script02_2_F046 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses01M_script02_2_F047 Or not.
Ses01M_script03_1_F003 Now and always sweet.
Ses01M_script03_1_F004 It had to happen sooner or later.
Ses01M_script03_1_F007 [BREATHING]
Ses01M_script03_1_F008 Oh. Behave exquisitely...
Ses01M_script03_1_F009 [LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.
Ses01M_script03_1_F010 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_F011 Mmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_F014 Oh, yes meaning just that.
Ses01M_script03_1_F015 [LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.
Ses01M_script03_1_F017 Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.
Ses01M_script03_1_F018 How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?
Ses01M_script03_1_F019 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses01M_script03_1_F021 If one of us dies...
Ses01M_script03_1_F024 I think you're talking nonsense.
Ses01M_script03_1_F030 Which particular one?
Ses01M_script03_1_F031 Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses01M_script03_1_F034 Cannes...mmhmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_F036 The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_F037 Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...
Ses01M_script03_1_F038 Utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses01M_script03_1_F039 oh...[LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_F040 Very much sillier.
Ses01M_script03_1_F041 Oh you knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01M_script03_2_F006 Well, what of it?
Ses01M_script03_2_F010 No, thank you.
Ses01M_script03_2_F011 I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.
Ses01M_script03_2_F015 Don't be stupid, what?
Ses01M_script03_2_F017 Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?
Ses01M_script03_2_F022 They sting.
Ses01M_script03_2_F023 I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
Ses01M_script03_2_F024 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses01M_script03_2_F025 Oh, mind you own business.
Ses01M_script03_2_F026 You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses01M_script03_2_F027 You always had a weak head.
Ses01M_script03_2_F028 On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses01M_script03_2_F029 Shut up.
Ses01M_script03_2_F030 Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?
Ses01M_script03_2_F031 Why?
Ses01M_script03_2_F033 They are away in Tunis.
Ses01M_script03_2_F034 Turn it on again, please.
Ses01M_script03_2_F035 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses01M_script03_2_F036 I won't.
Ses01M_script03_2_F037 Stop it. No. Go away.
Ses01M_script03_2_F038 listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.
Ses01M_script03_2_F039 Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible.
Ses01M_script03_2_F040 This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
Ses01M_script03_2_F041 Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.
Ses02F_impro01_M000 Hi.

Ses02F_impro03_M012 Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I'm shaking.  I can't even--
Ses02F_impro03_M013 Oh. Do they--do they know yet? Have you told them? Oh, that's--

Ses02F_impro03_M017 Spring's nice though.

Ses02F_impro03_M019 Okay.  All right.  So-[LAUGHTER]-quite a while.  I mean--That's-  That's good.  I'm so happy for you. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02F_impro03_M020 Yeah, I'd love to be in that same situation some day, but, wow- so-
Ses02F_impro03_M022 Oh, I approve. I-[LAUGHTER]-I more than approve.
Ses02F_impro03_M023 I mean, I'm surprised he didn't, ya know--go get a plane to fly over and shine--But candles on the beach, that's okay too I guess--
Ses02F_impro03_M024 Well--can--I mean, let me know--I want- I want invitations and--
Ses02F_impro03_M025 Oh, yes.  This is the whole [GARBAGE]
Ses02F_impro03_M026 It'll be good.  Wow, that's great.
Ses02F_impro04_M000 So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?
Ses02F_impro04_M001 No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't
Ses02F_impro04_M003 No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]
Ses02F_impro04_M004 I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--
Ses02F_impro04_M005 No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.
Ses02F_impro04_M006 There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...
Ses02F_impro04_M007 ...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know
Ses02F_impro04_M008 I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--
Ses02F_impro04_M009 But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?
Ses02F_impro04_M010 It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and...
Ses02F_impro04_M011 ... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--
Ses02F_impro04_M012 Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-
Ses02F_impro04_M013 Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know
Ses02F_impro04_M015 That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--
Ses02F_impro04_M016 Right.
Ses02F_impro04_M017 Well, you've gotta live.
Ses02F_impro04_M018 I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--
Ses02F_impro04_M019 Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though.
Ses02F_impro05_M000 Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--
Ses02F_impro05_M001 Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the--
Ses02F_impro05_M002 Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-
Ses02F_impro05_M003 You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen.
Ses02F_impro05_M004 Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--
Ses02F_impro05_M005 Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--
Ses02F_impro05_M006 Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do.
Ses02F_impro05_M007 I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--
Ses02F_impro05_M008 Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--
Ses02F_impro05_M009 Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um
Ses02F_impro05_M010 By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--
Ses02F_impro05_M011 Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--
Ses02F_impro05_M012 You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?
Ses02F_impro05_M013 Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--
Ses02F_impro05_M014 No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you
Ses02F_impro05_M015 probably even talk to--
Ses02F_impro05_M016 Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh
Ses02F_impro05_M017 but Unfortunately sometimes is--
Ses02F_impro05_M018 Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--
Ses02F_impro05_M019 Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.
Ses02F_impro05_M020 All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.
Ses02F_impro05_M021 Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.
Ses02F_impro06_M000 Hey, a what's up?
Ses02F_impro06_M001 Wow, that's horrible.
Ses02F_impro06_M002 I'm sorry to hear about that.
Ses02F_impro06_M003 Yeah.
Ses02F_impro06_M004 I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right?
Ses02F_impro06_M005 It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that.
Ses02F_impro06_M006 It's okay.
Ses02F_impro06_M007 'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on.
Ses02F_impro06_M008 I mean--I don't know.
Ses02F_impro06_M009 Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than...
Ses02F_impro06_M010 .than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean--
Ses02F_impro06_M011 But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and--
Ses02F_impro06_M012 Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and
Ses02F_impro06_M013 And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean--
Ses02F_impro06_M014 I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but--
Ses02F_impro06_M015 But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--
Ses02F_impro06_M016 No, you'll never forget him.
Ses02F_impro06_M017 I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--
Ses02F_impro06_M018 That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so .
Ses02F_impro06_M019 It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now.
Ses02F_impro07_M000 So, how's it going?
Ses02F_impro07_M001 Oh, you got what?  Where?
Ses02F_impro07_M002 Oh, no way.
Ses02F_impro07_M003 Are you gonna go? you gonna-
Ses02F_impro07_M004 Wow, that's...
Ses02F_impro07_M005 ...that's first choice, huh? That's so awesome and now look you're gonna be--you're gonna be here. you know
Ses02F_impro07_M006 Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna..
Ses02F_impro07_M007 Yeah.
Ses02F_impro07_M008 Yeah
Ses02F_impro07_M009 Fight on.
Ses02F_impro07_M010 [LAUGHTER]
Ses02F_impro07_M011 Wow. That's cool.
Ses02F_impro07_M016 So...
Ses02F_impro07_M017 Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess.
Ses02F_impro07_M018 That'll be awesome.
Ses02F_impro07_M019 I mean because you went to the campus before, right?
Ses02F_impro07_M023 Oh man.
Ses02F_impro07_M027 Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE]
Ses02F_impro07_M028 You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome.
Ses02F_impro07_M029 A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set.
Ses02F_impro07_M034 You're getting close to the beach.  I mean geez.
Ses02F_impro08_M003 Okay.
Ses02F_impro08_M005 You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.
Ses02F_impro08_M006 [BREATHING] that's good.
Ses02F_impro08_M007 All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.
Ses02F_impro08_M008 Okay. So--
Ses02F_impro08_M009 Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a
Ses02F_impro08_M010 --you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um
Ses02F_impro08_M011 Well, it's gonna be four of them.
Ses02F_impro08_M012 All right.  And can they like all get together?
Ses02F_impro08_M013 Um- You know, window is nice. I guess
Ses02F_impro08_M015 Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--
Ses02F_impro08_M016 And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.
Ses02F_impro08_M018 All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.
Ses02F_impro08_M019 Okay.
Ses02F_script01_1_M011 Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?
Ses02F_script01_1_M013 For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses02F_script01_1_M017 I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Ses02F_script01_1_M021 Well, then it isn't just my business--
Ses02F_script01_1_M023 She's not Larry's girl.
Ses02F_script01_1_M025 To hell with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_M027 Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses02F_script01_1_M029 Because it is.
Ses02F_script01_1_M036 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses02F_script01_1_M037 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02F_script01_1_M038 Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
Ses02F_script01_1_M040 Yes, on this I would.
Ses02F_script01_1_M043 I am thinkin' that way.
Ses02F_script01_1_M044 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses02F_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses02F_script01_2_M002 What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?
Ses02F_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02F_script01_2_M005 Well, so what?
Ses02F_script01_2_M006 Now, listen Kate.
Ses02F_script01_2_M007 You can't read her mind.
Ses02F_script01_2_M008 How do you know why she's waited?
Ses02F_script01_2_M016 What does that mean?  Me above all?
Ses02F_script01_2_M017 Look at you.  Look at you shaking.
Ses02F_script01_2_M018 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?
Ses02F_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses02F_script01_3_M010 You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.
Ses02F_script01_3_M020 No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02F_script01_3_M021 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses02F_script01_3_M022 I don't know how to start.
Ses02F_script01_3_M023 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
Ses02F_script01_3_M024 Well, I lost them.
Ses02F_script01_3_M025 Just about all.
Ses02F_script01_3_M026 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02F_script01_3_M027 For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses02F_script01_3_M028 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses02F_script01_3_M029 I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.
Ses02F_script01_3_M030 You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
Ses02F_script01_3_M031 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
Ses02F_script01_3_M032 And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
Ses02F_script01_3_M033 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
Ses02F_script01_3_M034 Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02F_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02F_script02_1_M001 This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.
Ses02F_script02_1_M002 I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.
Ses02F_script02_1_M003 How you doing?
Ses02F_script02_1_M004 Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.
Ses02F_script02_1_M005 Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?
Ses02F_script02_1_M006 How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.
Ses02F_script02_1_M009 Oh, well sure.
Ses02F_script02_1_M010 Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.
Ses02F_script02_1_M012 I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?
Ses02F_script02_1_M013 You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.
Ses02F_script02_1_M014 This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.
Ses02F_script02_1_M015 I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
Ses02F_script02_1_M016 You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02F_script02_1_M017 Do you want my jacket?
Ses02F_script02_1_M019 Right.
Ses02F_script02_1_M020 That's my point too.
Ses02F_script02_1_M021 No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
Ses02F_script02_1_M024 Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses02F_script02_1_M025 Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,
Ses02F_script02_1_M026 this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
Ses02F_script02_1_M028 Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.
Ses02F_script02_1_M031 I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.
Ses02F_script02_1_M033 We weren't in a good spot.
Ses02F_script02_1_M035 There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?
Ses02F_script02_1_M036 Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.
Ses02F_script02_1_M039 all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.
Ses02F_script02_1_M040 It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.
Ses02F_script02_1_M041 They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses02F_script02_1_M042 Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.
Ses02F_script02_1_M043 Well, so what do you think?
Ses02F_script02_1_M044 What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_M000 Well, so what do you think?
Ses02F_script02_2_M001 What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_M002 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02F_script02_2_M003 Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.
Ses02F_script02_2_M005 Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
Ses02F_script02_2_M007 There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.
Ses02F_script02_2_M009 We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.
Ses02F_script02_2_M010 Well, we'll see them this year.
Ses02F_script02_2_M013 It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.
Ses02F_script02_2_M016 You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."
Ses02F_script02_2_M017 Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--
Ses02F_script02_2_M018 Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses02F_script02_2_M019 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right?
Ses02F_script02_2_M020 Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?
Ses02F_script02_2_M021 Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?
Ses02F_script02_2_M022 You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses02F_script02_2_M023 Take off our shoes?
Ses02F_script02_2_M029 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?
Ses02F_script02_2_M031 No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us
Ses02F_script02_2_M033 Yes, it is.
Ses02F_script02_2_M034 Right.
Ses02F_script02_2_M035 I know, me neither.
Ses02F_script02_2_M036 I'm doing the best I can.
Ses02F_script02_2_M037 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses02F_script02_2_M038 No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses02F_script02_2_M041 I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.
Ses02F_script02_2_M042 Well, look what we have here.
Ses02F_script02_2_M043 It's not champagne.
Ses02F_script02_2_M045 Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses02F_script02_2_M046 Or not.
Ses02F_script03_1_M001 I wonder.
Ses02F_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses02F_script03_1_M005 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses02F_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise?
Ses02F_script03_1_M008 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
Ses02F_script03_1_M009 Oh, darling, don't say that.
Ses02F_script03_1_M010 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
Ses02F_script03_1_M012 You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.
Ses02F_script03_1_M013 All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.
Ses02F_script03_1_M014 Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses02F_script03_1_M015 Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.
Ses02F_script03_1_M016 Who knows.
Ses02F_script03_1_M017 No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.
Ses02F_script03_1_M018 Depends on how well we've played.
Ses02F_script03_1_M019 Yes.  Yes. With all his might.
Ses02F_script03_1_M020 No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.
Ses02F_script03_1_M021 So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02F_script03_1_M022 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses02F_script03_1_M023 Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses02F_script03_1_M024 I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.
Ses02F_script03_1_M025 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02F_script03_1_M026 The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.
Ses02F_script03_1_M028 How long did that row last?
Ses02F_script03_1_M029 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses02F_script03_1_M031 I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses02F_script03_1_M032 Oh, I'll never forget his face.
Ses02F_script03_1_M033 We were very much younger then.
Ses02F_script03_1_M034 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02F_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02F_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses02F_script03_2_M006 What of it?
Ses02F_script03_2_M007 Well, what about me?
Ses02F_script03_2_M009 Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?
Ses02F_script03_2_M011 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses02F_script03_2_M013 You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
Ses02F_script03_2_M027 I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses02F_script03_2_M030 We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.
Ses02F_script03_2_M036 I'll do no such thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses02F_script03_2_M038 Turn it off.
Ses02F_script03_2_M039 Amanda, listen. listen
Ses02F_script03_2_M041 You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02F_script03_2_M042 You're not going like this.
Ses02F_script03_2_M043 You're not.
Ses02F_script03_2_M044 Shut up. Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_M045 I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--
Ses02F_script03_2_M046 I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees
Ses02F_script03_2_M047 You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_impro01_M001 Yea. I just want to get this done,
Ses02M_impro01_M002 get my new license.
Ses02M_impro01_M003 Um, no, I got my driver's license though.
Ses02M_impro01_M004 Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -
Ses02M_impro01_M005 well is the dri-driver's license going to work?
Ses02M_impro01_M007 What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after
Ses02M_impro01_M008 three hours and
Ses02M_impro01_M009 Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?
Ses02M_impro01_M010 It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my
Ses02M_impro01_M011 I filled out the application right, didn't I?
Ses02M_impro01_M018 You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application
Ses02M_impro01_M019 What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.
Ses02M_impro02_M000 I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.
Ses02M_impro02_M001 You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and
Ses02M_impro02_M002 and
Ses02M_impro02_M007 You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?
Ses02M_impro02_M008 I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Ses02M_impro02_M009 I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.
Ses02M_impro02_M013 there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country
Ses02M_impro02_M014 and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back
Ses02M_impro02_M017 Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.
Ses02M_impro02_M018 I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.
Ses02M_impro03_M000 Oh, you're never going to believe it.
Ses02M_impro03_M001 Well, I finally did it
Ses02M_impro03_M005 Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know
Ses02M_impro03_M008 Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know
Ses02M_impro03_M009 I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.
Ses02M_impro03_M010 Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah
Ses02M_impro03_M011 so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-
Ses02M_impro03_M012 I-I did.
Ses02M_impro03_M014 I know, so
Ses02M_impro03_M015 I got to freak her out.
Ses02M_impro03_M016 No, yes -- so
Ses02M_impro03_M017 Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.
Ses02M_impro03_M018 No, but it was good.
Ses02M_impro03_M019 Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_M020 I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.
Ses02M_impro03_M021 Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...
Ses02M_impro03_M024 Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first
Ses02M_impro03_M026 I know.
Ses02M_impro03_M027 Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.
Ses02M_impro03_M028 Sure. Oh, yes.
Ses02M_impro03_M030 Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah
Ses02M_impro03_M031 Hah.
Ses02M_impro04_M014 I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking
Ses02M_impro04_M019 this doesn't happen to a normal person.
Ses02M_impro04_M022 Right. Thanks for talking to me.
Ses02M_impro05_M000 Hi. Um-
Ses02M_impro05_M001 It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.
Ses02M_impro05_M002 Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.
Ses02M_impro05_M003 Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know
Ses02M_impro05_M013 But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and
Ses02M_impro05_M016 Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-
Ses02M_impro05_M018 you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay
Ses02M_impro05_M025 The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-
Ses02M_impro05_M026 I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do
Ses02M_impro06_M000 Kathy died last night.
Ses02M_impro06_M001 yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -
Ses02M_impro06_M002 I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.
Ses02M_impro06_M003 I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,
Ses02M_impro06_M004 She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it.
Ses02M_impro06_M005 Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but
Ses02M_impro06_M006 God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go
Ses02M_impro06_M007 out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean.
Ses02M_impro06_M008 It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know
Ses02M_impro06_M009 not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.
Ses02M_impro06_M010 She was [garbage]
Ses02M_impro06_M011 Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great
Ses02M_impro06_M012 so loving everybody you know.
Ses02M_impro06_M013 Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.
Ses02M_impro06_M014 We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.
Ses02M_impro06_M015 Yes.  [BREATHING] God.
Ses02M_impro06_M016 I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it
Ses02M_impro06_M017 just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.
Ses02M_impro06_M018 Then she's gone.
Ses02M_impro06_M019 Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps
Ses02M_impro06_M020 to talk to somebody but
Ses02M_impro06_M021 It's just going to take a while, I think.
Ses02M_impro06_M022 Ah.
Ses02M_impro06_M023 Thank you.
Ses02M_impro07_M002 U.S.C..
Ses02M_impro07_M006 but big packet, big packet is nice
Ses02M_impro07_M007 So it's like, yes, rip it open and there it is big - oh, yes.
Ses02M_impro07_M008 Yeah. I know, I know.
Ses02M_impro07_M009 it was you know I wasn't too sure I mean you know it was kind of last minute for like the application
Ses02M_impro07_M010 and everything like but
Ses02M_impro07_M011 it was good, yeah. I mean-
Ses02M_impro07_M013 I'm looking forward to it.
Ses02M_impro07_M014 Hey, yes, you know that's - that's what I'm coming for.
Ses02M_impro07_M015 You're half the reason I'm going. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro07_M017 You know what I mean, I bet the home games, are just like nuts you know.
Ses02M_impro07_M018 What?
Ses02M_impro07_M019 [LAUGHTER] I know. I mean part of-
Ses02M_impro07_M020 Yeah. Right. A cult. I'm looking forward to being in the cult.
Ses02M_impro07_M021 Right I know, like you, it won't hurt, I mean national champions last year, wow, you know
Ses02M_impro07_M022 Maybe we'll do it again this year.
Ses02M_impro07_M023 What's that? ahh Well, you know I'm I'm thinking um I'm leaning towards like communications
Ses02M_impro07_M024 I-I don't know. Kind of a broad,
Ses02M_impro07_M025 yeah, I mean a lot-a lot  of good stuff oh, yeah, I mean it's- it's just a really good school; so really, whatever I pick I can't go wrong. I mean I'm just
Ses02M_impro07_M026 I'm looking forward to getting there. I mean, God, the campus is cool, you know it's like all just very confined I mean just you know it's a college campus you know it's like
Ses02M_impro07_M029 I mean you got to - you got to show me the ropes 'cause I've never been there before so I mean you know your way around already and- [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro07_M030 Oh, alright.
Ses02M_impro07_M031 I'm-I'm looking forward to that. [BREATHING] man, So yeah, I think I'm going to come out a little early so I mean I'll give you a call and we'll definitely-
Ses02M_impro07_M032 [LAUGHTER] Thanks, yes, thanks, yes That'll be cool.
Ses02M_impro08_M000 All right. Customer service this is Steve.
Ses02M_impro08_M002 Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.
Ses02M_impro08_M003 I- I'll give you a little hint, next time if it asks if you're on a rotary phone you know, just stay on the line instead of - instead of hitting one or two to say if you're like on a touch tone
Ses02M_impro08_M004 pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.
Ses02M_impro08_M005 I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.
Ses02M_impro08_M007 Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think
Ses02M_impro08_M008 Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here.
Ses02M_impro08_M009 All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's
Ses02M_impro08_M010 it- it'll work out fine.
Ses02M_impro08_M011 Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay.
Ses02M_impro08_M012 So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website.
Ses02M_impro08_M013 Yeah. Yeah. You get the form right now. and- yeah
Ses02M_impro08_M014 We could mail it to you as well, but-
Ses02M_impro08_M015 Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-
Ses02M_impro08_M016 and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know
Ses02M_impro08_M017 Right. I mean we might
Ses02M_impro08_M018 Okay.
Ses02M_impro08_M019 Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-
Ses02M_impro08_M020 Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so
Ses02M_impro08_M021 so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.
Ses02M_impro08_M022 Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-
Ses02M_impro08_M023 it's a different number and everything
Ses02M_impro08_M024 Yeah. yeah.
Ses02M_impro08_M025 Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?
Ses02M_impro08_M026 Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And
Ses02M_impro08_M027 And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um
Ses02M_impro08_M028 if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and
Ses02M_impro08_M029 and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-
Ses02M_impro08_M030 you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.
Ses02M_impro08_M031 Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of.
Ses02M_script01_1_M003 I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
Ses02M_script01_1_M004 No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses02M_script01_1_M005 I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
Ses02M_script01_1_M012 We've got to say it to him.
Ses02M_script01_1_M013 For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.
Ses02M_script01_1_M016 You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
Ses02M_script01_1_M017 You know.
Ses02M_script01_1_M018 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M021 See it isn't just my business-
Ses02M_script01_1_M024 I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.
Ses02M_script01_1_M025 To hell with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_M026 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses02M_script01_1_M027 Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.
Ses02M_script01_1_M028 I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M035 If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.
Ses02M_script01_1_M036 I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.
Ses02M_script01_1_M037 I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.
Ses02M_script01_1_M038 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M039 Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
Ses02M_script01_1_M041 Yes, on this I would.
Ses02M_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses02M_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02M_script01_2_M005 Well, so what?
Ses02M_script01_2_M007 You can't read her mind.
Ses02M_script01_2_M016 What does that mean, me above all?
Ses02M_script01_2_M017 Look at you -- look at you shaking.
Ses02M_script01_3_M000 I know, it went out of style, didn't it?
Ses02M_script01_3_M010 I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
Ses02M_script01_3_M014 You felt something that far back?
Ses02M_script01_3_M015 Ann, why didn't you let me know?
Ses02M_script01_3_M020 Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses02M_script01_3_M021 No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02M_script01_3_M022 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses02M_script01_3_M025 Well, I lost them.
Ses02M_script01_3_M026 Just about all.
Ses02M_script01_3_M027 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02M_script01_3_M028 For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.
Ses02M_script01_3_M029 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses02M_script01_3_M030 I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?
Ses02M_script01_3_M031 To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
Ses02M_script01_3_M032 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
Ses02M_script01_3_M033 And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
Ses02M_script01_3_M034 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
Ses02M_script01_3_M035 Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02M_script01_3_M036 I want you now Annie.
Ses02M_script02_1_M000 What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02M_script02_1_M001 God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.
Ses02M_script02_1_M003 How you doing?
Ses02M_script02_1_M004 Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.
Ses02M_script02_1_M005 Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?
Ses02M_script02_1_M006 How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?
Ses02M_script02_1_M013 You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?
Ses02M_script02_1_M014 Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,
Ses02M_script02_1_M015 oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
Ses02M_script02_1_M016 You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02M_script02_1_M023 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.
Ses02M_script02_1_M024 Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.
Ses02M_script02_1_M025 Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.
Ses02M_script02_1_M026 This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.
Ses02M_script02_1_M028 Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs
Ses02M_script02_1_M029 you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.
Ses02M_script02_1_M035 There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?
Ses02M_script02_1_M036 This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.
Ses02M_script02_1_M037 Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,
Ses02M_script02_1_M038 they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.
Ses02M_script02_1_M039 Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses02M_script02_1_M040 It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,
Ses02M_script02_1_M041 they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses02M_script02_1_M042 Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.
Ses02M_script02_2_M000 So what do you think?
Ses02M_script02_2_M001 What I was saying.
Ses02M_script02_2_M002 Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02M_script02_2_M010 Well, we'll see them this year.
Ses02M_script02_2_M015 You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said
Ses02M_script02_2_M016 "the Grunion are running tonight," I said "great, let's go, I feel lucky,"
Ses02M_script02_2_M017 okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-
Ses02M_script02_2_M019 It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?
Ses02M_script02_2_M020 Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?
Ses02M_script02_2_M021 Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?
Ses02M_script02_2_M022 You want to go get some champagne?
Ses02M_script02_2_M023 Take off our shoes?
Ses02M_script02_2_M025 Get married again?
Ses02M_script02_2_M029 Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?
Ses02M_script02_2_M035 No, I know. Me neither.
Ses02M_script02_2_M037 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses02M_script02_2_M038 No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.
Ses02M_script02_2_M040 Now that you mention it. No, I don't.
Ses02M_script02_2_M041 I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.
Ses02M_script02_2_M042 What have we got here?
Ses02M_script02_2_M045 Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses02M_script02_2_M046 Or not.
Ses02M_script03_1_M005 Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.
Ses02M_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise.
Ses02M_script03_1_M008 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?
Ses02M_script03_1_M009 Oh darling don't say that.
Ses02M_script03_1_M010 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?
Ses02M_script03_1_M011 What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?
Ses02M_script03_1_M012 You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.
Ses02M_script03_1_M014 flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.
Ses02M_script03_1_M015 Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.
Ses02M_script03_1_M016 No, that desire will fade along with our passion.
Ses02M_script03_1_M018 Yes, yes, with all his might.
Ses02M_script03_1_M019 No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.
Ses02M_script03_1_M020 So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02M_script03_1_M021 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses02M_script03_1_M022 Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses02M_script03_1_M024 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02M_script03_1_M029 That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses02M_script03_1_M031 I'll never forget his face.
Ses02M_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses02M_script03_2_M003 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you; you said you did.
Ses02M_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses02M_script03_2_M010 I have a little I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_M011 No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.
Ses02M_script03_2_M012 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses02M_script03_2_M016 Going out somewhere, dear?
Ses02M_script03_2_M018 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
Ses02M_script03_2_M024 Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses02M_script03_2_M026 What riotous time you must have had.
Ses02M_script03_2_M027 No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.
Ses02M_script03_2_M031 We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.
Ses02M_script03_2_M032 All right. I will.
Ses02M_script03_2_M033 Better turn that off I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_M039 Turn it off.
Ses02M_script03_2_M040 Amanda, listen. Listen.
Ses02M_script03_2_M041 Very amusing indeed.
Ses02M_script03_2_M042 You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_script03_2_M043 You're not going like this.
Ses02M_script03_2_M044 You're not.
Ses02M_script03_2_M045 Shut up.
Ses02M_script03_2_M046 Shut up.
Ses02M_script03_2_M047 I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses03F_impro01_F002 What's wrong?
Ses03F_impro02_F000 How's it going, babe?
Ses03F_impro02_F001 Yeah?
Ses03F_impro02_F005 oh.
Ses03F_impro02_F007 Well umm- actually they--I was promoted.
Ses03F_impro02_F008 And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.
Ses03F_impro02_F010 yeah.
Ses03F_impro02_F011 It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.
Ses03F_impro02_F012 yeah
Ses03F_impro02_F015 Yeah, and uh--
Ses03F_impro02_F018 Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.
Ses03F_impro02_F019 But it- it is for a year.
Ses03F_impro02_F020 Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.
Ses03F_impro02_F021 You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.
Ses03F_impro02_F023 Babe, I love you.
Ses03F_impro02_F024 But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.
Ses03F_impro02_F025 It's going to be okay.
Ses03F_impro02_F026 No, I have to go.
Ses03F_impro02_F027 Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.
Ses03F_impro02_F028 What do you mean?
Ses03F_impro02_F029 Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--
Ses03F_impro02_F031 and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--
Ses03F_impro02_F032 I will come back.
Ses03F_impro02_F034 we'll have all the money that we ever needed.
Ses03F_impro02_F035 And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.
Ses03F_impro02_F036 It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.
Ses03F_impro02_F037 Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.
Ses03F_impro02_F038 Don't do that to me.
Ses03F_impro02_F039 It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't.
Ses03F_impro02_F040 I know.
Ses03F_impro02_F041 I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.
Ses03F_impro02_F042 I'm sorry, babe.
Ses03F_impro02_F043 I'm so sorry.
Ses03F_impro03_F004 at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and
Ses03F_impro03_F005 Joe's gone. -where did he go, you know?
Ses03F_impro03_F006 And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-
Ses03F_impro03_F007 he comes up onstage-- And the entire cast everyone just like
Ses03F_impro03_F008 goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.
Ses03F_impro03_F009 And I'm like freaking out. I'm like what the hell's going on, you know. I don't know what's going on. And so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone-
Ses03F_impro03_F011 he asked me to marry him, like- onstage. I was like, I couldn't believe--and I had to walk up there and I was, like I think I tripped or something.
Ses03F_impro03_F012 Yeah, I said yes, but I, yeah, I mean,
Ses03F_impro03_F013 I don't know- it just like took me, took me by surprise.
Ses03F_impro03_F014 He scored points.
Ses03F_impro03_F015 Oh, yeah. Everyone--yeah. And people--friends of ours were in the audience, I didn't know about, like family members.
Ses03F_impro03_F016 Yeah. It was great.
Ses03F_impro03_F017 It was--I cried,
Ses03F_impro03_F018 like a loser, I cried.
Ses03F_impro03_F019 But, I don't know, I--it's so weird to think I'm marrying somebody 'cause I feel so young, you know?
Ses03F_impro03_F020 No. No plans. or any- and probably
Ses03F_impro03_F021 like I think I want to get married--I want to have two weddings. One here, then one in Europe.
Ses03F_impro03_F024 Yeah. I'm so excited. [LAUGHTER].
Ses03F_impro04_F002 I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything.
Ses03F_impro04_F022 it's not funny. I just don't know what I'm going to do.
Ses03F_impro04_F023 Yeah, I guess I could.
Ses03F_impro04_F024 Yeah
Ses03F_impro05_F002 Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?
Ses03F_impro05_F005 Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?
Ses03F_impro05_F007 What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.
Ses03F_impro05_F008 Not to mention I have my work in there.
Ses03F_impro05_F009 And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?
Ses03F_impro05_F010 Fifteen percent?
Ses03F_impro05_F011 What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.
Ses03F_impro05_F015 No, they said I couldn't lock it.
Ses03F_impro05_F016 Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.
Ses03F_impro05_F017 Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then.
Ses03F_impro06_F000 Okay.
Ses03F_impro06_F001 Yeah. Wow.
Ses03F_impro06_F002 Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F003 It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-
Ses03F_impro06_F004 he had cancer, you know?
Ses03F_impro06_F005 They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad.
Ses03F_impro06_F006 Turned around for the worst, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F007 He was amazing.
Ses03F_impro06_F008 I loved that boy.
Ses03F_impro06_F009 We did everything together, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F010 It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.
Ses03F_impro06_F011 He's so young. It seems so--
Ses03F_impro06_F012 so wrong in so many ways.
Ses03F_impro06_F013 His poor parents. You know, it's their only son.
Ses03F_impro06_F014 Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease.
Ses03F_impro06_F015 I know. He was, he had so much going for him.
Ses03F_impro06_F016 So handsome, so young, so gifted.
Ses03F_impro06_F017 So talented.
Ses03F_impro06_F018 Such a sweet person, you know?
Ses03F_impro06_F019 Not very good.
Ses03F_impro06_F020 Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.
Ses03F_impro06_F021 It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?
Ses03F_impro06_F022 Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.
Ses03F_impro06_F023 He was like, he was like my brother, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F024 He was my brother.
Ses03F_impro06_F025 Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.
Ses03F_impro06_F026 You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and-
Ses03F_impro06_F027 Kelly. Kelly Uveny.
Ses03F_impro06_F028 They talked about getting married and--
Ses03F_impro06_F029 Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-
Ses03F_impro06_F030 so I was there for him.
Ses03F_impro06_F031 Yeah. God, I loved that kid.
Ses03F_impro06_F032 yeah.
Ses03F_impro06_F033 Joe, do you think he knew I loved him?
Ses03F_impro06_F034 I never told him, I love you, but-
Ses03F_impro06_F035 I loved him so much.
Ses03F_impro07_F001 Uh-, So I got some good news.
Ses03F_impro07_F004 I have some better news than that.
Ses03F_impro07_F005 Yes, What would you want more than anything in this world?
Ses03F_impro07_F007 I got--U.S.C.. I got- Yeah, I got the acceptance letter.
Ses03F_impro07_F008 Yes, me, I got in. Thank you very much.
Ses03F_impro07_F009 Yeah, I know, my mom called me. I was with my girlfriend in Boston, and uh- she got the letter and she called me, she said I don't know, do you want me to open it? And I was like yes, open it. And she opened it and she goes oh, I'm sorry, Nat.
Ses03F_impro07_F011 And my mom was like Natalie, Natalie, it's [GARBAGE], you know-
Ses03F_impro07_F012 and so, I mean, I got in.
Ses03F_impro07_F013 So now I can stay here and now we can party. I know.
Ses03F_impro07_F014 Yeah, why not.
Ses03F_impro07_F015 We're not twenty one yet, but whatever.
Ses03F_impro07_F016 [LAUGHTER]. I'm so excited, Joe. Oh, man, I-- And I got in--I got into the school of theatre, so it's like-
Ses03F_impro07_F017 Yeah. It's really cool.
Ses03F_impro07_F019 Top five in the nation.
Ses03F_impro07_F020 Acting Pants? So what are you going to do? Are you--you're be--you're going to stay here, right?
Ses03F_impro07_F021 Awesome. We're both going to be in L.A.
Ses03F_impro07_F022 I'm so excited. Yeah, I thought I was going to go to Boston, but then--
Ses03F_impro07_F023 Oh man, I'm so excited. So much to do.
Ses03F_impro07_F025 I'm just so excited to start my life.
Ses03F_impro07_F026 Oh, and you sit down and you have the sponge bread-- --and eat the--drink the beer. Ugh, I love that stuff. I'm so excited.
Ses03F_impro07_F027 Are you going to come stay in my dorm with me sometime?
Ses03F_impro07_F028 Yeah. I'll get like one of those little--
Ses03F_impro07_F029 Yeah. Those little-- --mattresses. I'll put it by my bed.
Ses03F_impro07_F031 That's going to--that'll be reserved for somebody else.
Ses03F_impro07_F032 [LAUGHTER] Hello? I am not.
Ses03F_impro07_F034 [LAUGHTER]. No, you'd get used to it.
Ses03F_impro07_F035 [LAUGHTER]. Oh, Joe, I'm so happy.
Ses03F_impro08_F000 Hello sir, can I help you?
Ses03F_impro08_F001 I [GARBAGE]
Ses03F_impro08_F002 Yes, sir, I'm very sorry, but we've had some trouble here.  There's been a lot of calls and the system has-
Ses03F_impro08_F003 Sir, please calm down.  There's no reason to use profanity like that.  It's not-
Ses03F_impro08_F004 Okay, and this is for Verizon? Your provider?
Ses03F_impro08_F005 Well, um- we have a little problem with the system going on.  One of our satellites is down, and I-
Ses03F_impro08_F006 You're going to have to just be patient with us, sir, as we
Ses03F_impro08_F007 Well, I know sir, and we all are busy.
Ses03F_impro08_F008 But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information
Ses03F_impro08_F009 Okay, well, if you would like, um- we will be turning on the systems in probably about ten hours.
Ses03F_impro08_F010 Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use.
Ses03F_impro08_F011 Do you have a land line, sir?
Ses03F_impro08_F012 Okay, well, we will send you- We will reimburse you for the amount of minutes that you-
Ses03F_impro08_F013 -on average would use.
Ses03F_impro08_F014 And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir.
Ses03F_impro08_F015 No, we don't just give you things.  We're- we're-
Ses03F_impro08_F016 we compensating you for all your-
Ses03F_impro08_F020 Three days?
Ses03F_impro08_F021 A day?
Ses03F_impro08_F022 I don't know, sir.
Ses03F_impro08_F023 Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-
Ses03F_impro08_F024 Well, ten hours worth of minutes--
Ses03F_impro08_F025 is what's going to happen.
Ses03F_impro08_F026 Sir,
Ses03F_impro08_F027 what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-
Ses03F_impro08_F028 and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.
Ses03F_impro08_F029 Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.
Ses03F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses03F_script01_1_F005 He cried hard, huh?
Ses03F_script01_1_F007 Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?
Ses03F_script01_1_F010 What do you mean, dishonest?
Ses03F_script01_1_F014 They do come back.
Ses03F_script01_1_F017 It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.
Ses03F_script01_1_F019 Why?
Ses03F_script01_1_F021 Well, that's only your business, Chris.
Ses03F_script01_1_F030 You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F031 There's nothing wrong with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_F045 Tell me something.
Ses03F_script01_1_F046 You'd leave that business.
Ses03F_script01_1_F050 I'm going to.
Ses03F_script01_1_F052 I don't know you, do I?
Ses03F_script01_1_F053 Yeah. I can see that.
Ses03F_script01_2_F000 Why did you invite her here?
Ses03F_script01_2_F001 She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-
Ses03F_script01_2_F002 You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses03F_script01_2_F004 It's got that about it.
Ses03F_script01_2_F006 She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.
Ses03F_script01_2_F011 She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-
Ses03F_script01_2_F013 Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses03F_script01_2_F015 Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.
Ses03F_script01_2_F016 Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.
Ses03F_script01_2_F018 No, you've got to believe.
Ses03F_script01_2_F020 You got to keep believing.
Ses03F_script01_2_F021 I can't help it.
Ses03F_script01_3_F000 You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
Ses03F_script01_3_F001 No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.
Ses03F_script01_3_F002 It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.
Ses03F_script01_3_F003 No. I'm not sorry. It's-
Ses03F_script01_3_F008 Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.
Ses03F_script01_3_F011 Well, I mean,
Ses03F_script01_3_F012 from her opinion, why else would I come here?
Ses03F_script01_3_F013 Well, I guess that's why I came.
Ses03F_script01_3_F014 I've been ready for a long, long time.
Ses03F_script01_3_F018 Every day since.
Ses03F_script01_3_F021 I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F023 Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.
Ses03F_script01_3_F025 No. What is it? Is it your mother?
Ses03F_script01_3_F026 Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.
Ses03F_script01_3_F027 You should tell me.
Ses03F_script01_3_F028 But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.
Ses03F_script01_3_F029 Yeah, sure.
Ses03F_script01_3_F030 How many?
Ses03F_script01_3_F031 Geez.
Ses03F_script01_3_F032 And you still feel that way?
Ses03F_script01_3_F033 Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.
Ses03F_script01_3_F035 What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses03F_script02_1_F003 I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?
Ses03F_script02_1_F010 Not particularly.
Ses03F_script02_1_F011 I don't know. I just don't.
Ses03F_script02_1_F012 Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
Ses03F_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses03F_script02_2_F005 Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.
Ses03F_script02_2_F012 Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.
Ses03F_script02_2_F016 Do you remember the last time we came here?
Ses03F_script02_2_F017 We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03F_script02_2_F018 You brought a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F019 We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.
Ses03F_script02_2_F020 And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.
Ses03F_script02_2_F021 Oh, that moment-that was it.
Ses03F_script02_2_F022 I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.
Ses03F_script02_2_F023 Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F024 I don't want to remember something.
Ses03F_script02_2_F025 Hope for some things.
Ses03F_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F027 No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F028 No, no.
Ses03F_script02_2_F031 No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F035 No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.
Ses03F_script02_2_F036 Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.
Ses03F_script02_2_F038 it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03F_script02_2_F039 I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.
Ses03F_script02_2_F040 I didn't say that.
Ses03F_script02_2_F043 Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.
Ses03F_script02_2_F044 I noticed that. It's beautiful.
Ses03F_script02_2_F045 You can see right over the water.
Ses03F_script02_2_F048 At least we won't need glasses.
Ses03F_script02_2_F050 Maybe this is the right place after all.
Ses03F_script02_2_F051 I'm sorry, Augie.
Ses03F_script03_1_F000 [BREATHING]
Ses03F_script03_1_F001 Do you think it's them?
Ses03F_script03_1_F009 Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
Ses03F_script03_1_F014 Oh dear, well, shall we want that?
Ses03F_script03_1_F015 Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses03F_script03_1_F019 Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.
Ses03F_script03_1_F021 Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses03F_script03_1_F025 yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses03F_script03_1_F026 The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_script03_1_F027 I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.
Ses03F_script03_2_F004 Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.
Ses03F_script03_2_F008 Well, it's true.
Ses03F_script03_2_F013 It's become a habit with you.
Ses03F_script03_2_F014 Don't be so stupid.
Ses03F_script03_2_F015 What?
Ses03F_script03_2_F017 It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?
Ses03F_script03_2_F018 No, it isn't.
Ses03F_script03_2_F023 I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.
Ses03F_script03_2_F026 You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_F035 Turn it on.
Ses03F_script03_2_F037 I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.
Ses03F_script03_2_F038 Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses03F_script03_2_F039 Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.
Ses03F_script03_2_F040 This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.
Ses03F_script03_2_F041 Oh, yes I am.
Ses03F_script03_2_F042 Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.
Ses03F_script03_2_F043 Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.
Ses03M_impro01_F000 Is that a demand sir?
Ses03M_impro01_F003 No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.
Ses03M_impro01_F022 Okay.  I'm going to call security. Security!
Ses03M_impro01_F025 This entire time you're fighting with me sir, you could've finished the form and already been half way-- No.  Get out.
Ses03M_impro02_F000 Um.
Ses03M_impro02_F003 Why the sad face?
Ses03M_impro02_F013 Do this whole thing by myself?
Ses03M_impro02_F014 Carry her for nine months and then yes.
Ses03M_impro02_F015 It's not the same thing.  It's not like having you here.
Ses03M_impro02_F016 I can't do this.
Ses03M_impro02_F017 I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.
Ses03M_impro02_F022 and watch our child grow, see her take her first steps, her first words.
Ses03M_impro02_F023 You said two years.
Ses03M_impro02_F024 A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.
Ses03M_impro02_F025 What could happen in a year?
Ses03M_impro02_F026 And this isn't the first time you know?  I mean you always...sending you off to different places and...
Ses03M_impro02_F027 I don't know if that's how I want to live my life.
Ses03M_impro02_F028 Joe I'm serious I don't want to have to have a little girl to tell...asking every day where's daddy, where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away--
Ses03M_impro02_F029 far away and he won't be here.
Ses03M_impro02_F030 I'm done.  I can't honey.
Ses03M_impro02_F031 It's over.
Ses03M_impro02_F032 Honey I can't do it anymore.
Ses03M_impro02_F033 I need you here.  Anna needs you.
Ses03M_impro02_F034 yeah.
Ses03M_impro03_F001 What?
Ses03M_impro03_F003 Chuck E. Cheese?  Ah, man that is so lame.
Ses03M_impro03_F004 Are you serious [GARBAGE] man?
Ses03M_impro03_F005 Oh like that one movie.  What's that one movie I just saw? No.  Where she like swallows the...
Ses03M_impro03_F006 oh, I don't remember.  Everybody Says I Love You with Drew Barrymore...no you haven't seen it?  Okay.
Ses03M_impro03_F010 [LAUGHTER] So nasty. No you... dirty me?
Ses03M_impro03_F012 She actually asked if it was real?  I would've probably asked the same thing considering you were in Chuck E. Cheese.
Ses03M_impro03_F015 Yeah.  That's, you know, okay.
Ses03M_impro03_F016 Oh god! You are damn cheap, cheap, cheap. Anyways, moving on. It's not like you're poor.  I mean your dad makes... okey
Ses03M_impro03_F017 You had the mouse?
Ses03M_impro03_F018 Isn't it a rat?  It's a rat.  Chuck E. Cheese?
Ses03M_impro03_F021 Okay, that is really cheesy Joe.
Ses03M_impro03_F022 Oh that's kind of sweet.
Ses03M_impro03_F023 Wait, wait, wait I want you to marry me?  No, shouldn't you like be more like a question like, would you marry me?  Not like I want you to marry me.  It's like a demand.
Ses03M_impro03_F024 You marry me. I man I Jane, you Tarzan.
Ses03M_impro03_F025 She said sure?
Ses03M_impro03_F026 Sure?  Who says sure?  You say yes...I don't like--
Ses03M_impro03_F027 How long have you guys been going out?
Ses03M_impro03_F033 She must be hot.

Ses03M_impro04_F001 Well have you been trying to get a job, look for a job or...?
Ses03M_impro04_F003 Well what are you looking for?  I mean--
Ses03M_impro04_F004 Well, okay. Well that's--

Ses03M_impro04_F014 I am...just like a law clerk.
Ses03M_impro04_F015 Well, I'm moving up.  I mean it could be...
Ses03M_impro04_F023 Well... If you need something, I mean, you're just going to---can get a temporary thing right now and then look for something--

Ses03M_impro05a_F011 I'm sorry sir.
Ses03M_impro05a_F012 I'm very sorry but let's check on this immediately.  This is definitely an emergency.  It seems--
Ses03M_impro05a_F014 Yes--it is
Ses03M_impro05a_F016 Okay.  We will find your luggage.  Apparently because it somehow...what flight you were taking, you were on Delta?

Ses03M_impro08a_F014 I want to talk to a supervisor
Ses03M_impro08a_F015 I would like to talk to your supervisor.  Obviously you're incompetent and don't understand what I'm asking.
Ses03M_impro08a_F020 This is ridiculous.Well what are we supposed to do?  We starve then because I can't use my phone cause
Ses03M_impro08a_F021 I am a realtor and this is my business.  People are calling me all the time but you know, and I don't have a land line.  I can't afford to have a land line
Ses03M_impro08a_F022 That you better be sorry.
Ses03M_impro08b_F005 Yeah, yeah, yeah you better be sorry.
Ses03M_impro08b_F006 No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.
Ses03M_impro08b_F021 Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,
Ses03M_impro08b_F023 Okay.
Ses03M_impro08b_F024 Alright Thanks.
Ses03M_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.
Ses03M_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses03M_script01_1_F005 He cried hard?
Ses03M_script01_1_F008 He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?
Ses03M_script01_1_F016 No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.
Ses03M_script01_1_F017 Why?
Ses03M_script01_1_F020 Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses03M_script01_1_F021 Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--
Ses03M_script01_1_F028 Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses03M_script01_1_F030 Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...
Ses03M_script01_1_F038 You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.
Ses03M_script01_1_F040 Tell me something.  You can leave this business?
Ses03M_script01_1_F043 I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.
Ses03M_script01_1_F045 I don't understand you do I?
Ses03M_script01_1_F046 Yeah.  I can see that.
Ses03M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses03M_script01_2_F001 Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.
Ses03M_script01_2_F006 No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.
Ses03M_script01_2_F009 I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.
Ses03M_script01_2_F010 My worst times I think about her, you know, and I
Ses03M_script01_2_F011 it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.
Ses03M_script01_2_F012 No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.
Ses03M_script01_2_F015 Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.
Ses03M_script01_2_F017 Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.
Ses03M_script01_2_F019 I can't help it.
Ses03M_script01_3_F004 No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses03M_script01_3_F006 Look,
Ses03M_script01_3_F007 you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...
Ses03M_script01_3_F008 Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.
Ses03M_script01_3_F011 Well,
Ses03M_script01_3_F012 I guess that's why I came.
Ses03M_script01_3_F013 Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.
Ses03M_script01_3_F014 Look, I almost got married two years ago.
Ses03M_script01_3_F015 You started to write me.
Ses03M_script01_3_F016 Every day since.
Ses03M_script01_3_F017 I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?
Ses03M_script01_3_F018 You'd always be so ambiguous.
Ses03M_script01_3_F019 I'll never forgive you for that.
Ses03M_script01_3_F020 I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F021 Not like that you're not.
Ses03M_script01_3_F029 How many?
Ses03M_script01_3_F030 Geez.
Ses03M_script01_3_F031 And you still feel that way?
Ses03M_script01_3_F033 that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses03M_script01_3_F034 What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03M_script02_1_F005 Yes.
Ses03M_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses03M_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses03M_script02_2_F001 It's ridiculous.
Ses03M_script02_2_F002 It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.
Ses03M_script02_2_F003 Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.
Ses03M_script02_2_F004 Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.
Ses03M_script02_2_F009 Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.
Ses03M_script02_2_F011 Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses03M_script02_2_F013 Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.
Ses03M_script02_2_F016 No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.
Ses03M_script02_2_F018 We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03M_script02_2_F023 I'd rather not remember something...
Ses03M_script02_2_F024 Rather not hope for something.
Ses03M_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses03M_script02_2_F031 I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
Ses03M_script02_2_F033 Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.
Ses03M_script02_2_F034 This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03M_script02_2_F035 I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.
Ses03M_script02_2_F036 I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses03M_script02_2_F037 I didn't say that.
Ses03M_script02_2_F038 Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.
Ses03M_script02_2_F040 If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.
Ses03M_script02_2_F041 Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.
Ses03M_script02_2_F042 Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.
Ses03M_script02_2_F044 Oh you brought refreshments.
Ses03M_script02_2_F046 No I'm beginning to think you might be right.
Ses03M_script02_2_F047 I think this may be the place for us after all.
Ses03M_script02_2_F048 I am sorry Augie.
Ses03M_script02_2_F049 Or not.
Ses03M_script03_1_F003 Now and always sweet.
Ses03M_script03_1_F004 I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.
Ses03M_script03_1_F005 That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses03M_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses03M_script03_1_F018 That's serious enough.
Ses03M_script03_2_F000 Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.
Ses03M_script03_2_F001 Presents?  A trivial little broach.
Ses03M_script03_2_F003 No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.
Ses03M_script03_2_F004 Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.
Ses03M_script03_2_F006 Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.
Ses03M_script03_2_F010 I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
Ses03M_script03_2_F011 I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_F012 It's become a habit with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses03M_script03_2_F016 No, just making myself beautiful for you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F017 That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?
Ses03M_script03_2_F024 Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses03M_script03_2_F025 They sting.
Ses03M_script03_2_F028 Mind your business.
Ses03M_script03_2_F029 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_F030 You've always had a weak head.
Ses03M_script03_2_F031 On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.
Ses03M_script03_2_F032 Shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_F033 Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.
Ses03M_script03_2_F036 They are away in Tunis.
Ses03M_script03_2_F038 Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.
Ses03M_script03_2_F039 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses03M_script03_2_F040 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F041 I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses03M_script03_2_F042 This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.
Ses03M_script03_2_F043 Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.
Ses03M_script03_2_F044 Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-
Ses03M_script03_2_F045 Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.
Ses04F_impro01_M005 I've got a life too ma'am
Ses04F_impro01_M008 There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.
Ses04F_impro01_M011 You're going to have to go back again.
Ses04F_impro01_M014 Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.
Ses04F_impro01_M021 like I said before right now.
Ses04F_impro01_M023 You're testing my goddamn patience.
Ses04F_impro01_M024 I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?
Ses04F_impro02_M000 So you're leaving tomorrow.
Ses04F_impro02_M001 This is really-this is unfair.
Ses04F_impro02_M004 And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.
Ses04F_impro02_M012 I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.
Ses04F_impro02_M018 That's all I'm saying... No you don't.
Ses04F_impro02_M020 You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.
Ses04F_impro02_M021 Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-
Ses04F_impro02_M024 I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?
Ses04F_impro02_M025 You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?
Ses04F_impro02_M026 Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.
Ses04F_impro03_M000 What?  You seem so excited.
Ses04F_impro03_M001 Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.
Ses04F_impro03_M003 Holy shit that's amazing.
Ses04F_impro03_M004 Congratulations.
Ses04F_impro03_M005 I'm invited, right.
Ses04F_impro03_M014 Yeah.  I'll help plan.
Ses04F_impro03_M018 Why not browns?
Ses04F_impro03_M019 It's a light brown, tanish.
Ses04F_impro03_M020 I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-
Ses04F_impro03_M021 I know but you just asked me to-
Ses04F_impro03_M027 Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?
Ses04F_impro03_M028 Blue?
Ses04F_impro03_M029 Okay, fine. Greens and blues.
Ses04F_impro03_M030 Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?
Ses04F_impro03_M031 Yeah?
Ses04F_impro03_M032 Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?
Ses04F_impro03_M033 I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.
Ses04F_impro03_M034 Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.
Ses04F_impro03_M035 Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.
Ses04F_impro03_M036 Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.
Ses04F_impro03_M037 I'm thrilled.  God.
Ses04F_impro03_M038 Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend
Ses04F_impro03_M039 You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing
Ses04F_impro03_M040 Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.
Ses04F_impro03_M041 I'm so- all the blood
Ses04F_impro03_M042 has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.
Ses04F_impro03_M043 I'm getting a little weak in the knees.
Ses04F_impro03_M047 I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.
Ses04F_impro04_M001 Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.
Ses04F_impro04_M002 Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.
Ses04F_impro04_M003 I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-
Ses04F_impro04_M004 I don't know.
Ses04F_impro04_M005 Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.
Ses04F_impro04_M006 Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.
Ses04F_impro04_M007 You need that- Time-
Ses04F_impro04_M008 You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M009 look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M013 I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.
Ses04F_impro04_M014 Yeah, I understand, but-
Ses04F_impro04_M015 I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M016 Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_M017 'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-
Ses04F_impro04_M018 Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?
Ses04F_impro04_M019 And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?
Ses04F_impro04_M020 and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,
Ses04F_impro04_M021 you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.
Ses04F_impro04_M022 or some- some large percent of- of success.
Ses04F_impro04_M023 Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-
Ses04F_impro04_M026 Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-
Ses04F_impro04_M028 Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M030 I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-
Ses04F_impro04_M031 I'm trying to be helpful.
Ses04F_impro04_M033 I'm trying to watch TV.
Ses04F_impro06_M000 Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-
Ses04F_impro06_M001 When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.
Ses04F_impro06_M002 Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.
Ses04F_impro06_M003 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_M004 Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,
Ses04F_impro06_M005 you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like
Ses04F_impro06_M006 you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.
Ses04F_impro06_M007 It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.
Ses04F_impro06_M008 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_M009 It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.
Ses04F_impro06_M010 You're okay
Ses04F_impro06_M011 You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.
Ses04F_impro06_M012 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_M013 That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.
Ses04F_impro06_M014 So-
Ses04F_impro07_M000 Hey, what's up?
Ses04F_impro07_M001 What?
Ses04F_impro07_M005 That's awesome.  Congratulations.
Ses04F_impro07_M006 That's amazing.  Wow.
Ses04F_impro07_M009 I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-
Ses04F_impro07_M013 So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?
Ses04F_impro07_M016 they have that as a major?
Ses04F_impro07_M017 That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.
Ses04F_impro07_M018 Seriously, what's your major?
Ses04F_impro07_M019 So you're undecided?
Ses04F_impro07_M020 Hey, that's cool.
Ses04F_impro07_M021 No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.
Ses04F_impro07_M022 Uh, well-
Ses04F_impro07_M023 You- you- you'll find.
Ses04F_impro07_M026 You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.
Ses04F_impro07_M028 That's awesome.
Ses04F_impro07_M031 Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.
Ses04F_impro07_M032 A party celebrating your acceptance.
Ses04F_impro07_M033 That's cool.
Ses04F_impro07_M034 Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm
Ses04F_impro07_M035 I don't know are you, like, I don't know.  Are you, like, available or anything?
Ses04F_impro07_M036 Well I mean I don't know.  It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like
Ses04F_impro07_M037 I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is.
Ses04F_impro07_M038 Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and
Ses04F_impro07_M039 actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on
Ses04F_impro07_M040 Vermont.
Ses04F_impro07_M041 Wait, you've been there before?
Ses04F_impro07_M042 Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome.
Ses04F_impro07_M043 Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.
Ses04F_impro07_M044 Okay.  Putt-putt golfing?
Ses04F_impro07_M045 Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go.
Ses04F_impro07_M046 I can see it in your eyes.  You want to go.
Ses04F_impro07_M049 Good. Alright we're so happy.
Ses04F_impro07_M050 That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school.
Ses04F_impro07_M051 Are you going to take out loans or-
Ses04F_impro07_M057 But, um-
Ses04F_impro07_M058 I mean, like, I don't know.  I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash.  You can, you know
Ses04F_impro07_M059 Or library.
Ses04F_impro07_M060 I just said the library
Ses04F_impro07_M061 or, um, campus cruiser.  You can drive people around.
Ses04F_impro07_M062 Right or you can run for student counsel.
Ses04F_impro07_M063 Dorky?
Ses04F_impro07_M064 It's important.
Ses04F_impro07_M066 Fine.  It's dorky.
Ses04F_impro07_M067 But that'll fit you  because you're a dork.
Ses04F_impro07_M070 I dork.
Ses04F_impro07_M071 Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by
Ses04F_impro07_M072 lots of drunk frat boys
Ses04F_impro07_M073 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro07_M076 I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.
Ses04F_impro07_M077 Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?
Ses04F_impro07_M079 I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-
Ses04F_impro07_M080 No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus
Ses04F_impro07_M082 that happened, you know, that was going on.
Ses04F_impro08_M001 Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food
Ses04F_impro08_M012 It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.
Ses04F_impro08_M013 Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.
Ses04F_impro08_M014 Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now
Ses04F_impro08_M015 and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.
Ses04F_impro08_M016 You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.
Ses04F_impro08_M017 You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.
Ses04F_impro08_M018 You're going to fill out a form on your desk
Ses04F_impro08_M019 because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.
Ses04F_impro08_M022 Cindy?  Cindy what?
Ses04F_impro08_M023 Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check
Ses04F_impro08_M024 attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.
Ses04F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses04F_script01_1_M004 No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.
Ses04F_script01_1_M005 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
Ses04F_script01_1_M009 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses04F_script01_1_M010 I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.
Ses04F_script01_1_M012 We've got to say it to him.
Ses04F_script01_1_M013 For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses04F_script01_1_M016 You know why.
Ses04F_script01_1_M017 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses04F_script01_1_M020 Then it isn't just my business.
Ses04F_script01_1_M021 Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.
Ses04F_script01_1_M022 Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.
Ses04F_script01_1_M025 To hell with that.
Ses04F_script01_1_M026 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses04F_script01_1_M028 and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.
Ses04F_script01_1_M029 So what I'm not fast with women.
Ses04F_script01_1_M030 Because it is.
Ses04F_script01_1_M032 These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?
Ses04F_script01_1_M034 I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry
Ses04F_script01_1_M038 The business, the business doesn't inspire me.
Ses04F_script01_2_M000 Why does that bother you?
Ses04F_script01_2_M001 Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses04F_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses04F_script01_2_M007 Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe
Ses04F_script01_2_M008 You can't read her mind.
Ses04F_script01_2_M017 What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.
Ses04F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses04F_script01_3_M008 I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.
Ses04F_script01_3_M009 Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M010 I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M011 I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I
Ses04F_script01_3_M014 And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
Ses04F_script01_3_M018 Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M019 I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M020 Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses04F_script01_3_M023 No, nothing like that.
Ses04F_script01_3_M024 Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.
Ses04F_script01_3_M026 There's so many things mixed up.
Ses04F_script01_3_M027 You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses04F_script01_3_M028 Well I lost them.
Ses04F_script01_3_M029 Just about all.
Ses04F_script01_3_M030 It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
Ses04F_script01_3_M031 For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.
Ses04F_script01_3_M032 I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.
Ses04F_script01_3_M033 They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses04F_script01_3_M034 And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made
Ses04F_script01_3_M035 a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?
Ses04F_script01_3_M036 And then I came home and it was amazing.
Ses04F_script01_3_M039 I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
Ses04F_script01_3_M040 because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.
Ses04F_script01_3_M041 I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.
Ses04F_script01_3_M043 when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.
Ses04F_script01_3_M044 Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.
Ses04F_script01_3_M045 I guess that included you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M047 Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses04F_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
Ses04F_script02_1_M002 Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell
Ses04F_script02_1_M009 I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
Ses04F_script02_1_M010 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
Ses04F_script02_1_M011 Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses04F_script02_1_M017 That's my point too.
Ses04F_script02_1_M021 Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses04F_script02_1_M023 This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
Ses04F_script02_1_M026 like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic
Ses04F_script02_1_M031 We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.
Ses04F_script02_1_M032 I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.
Ses04F_script02_1_M033 Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
Ses04F_script02_1_M034 Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.
Ses04F_script02_1_M035 No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
Ses04F_script02_1_M036 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses04F_script02_1_M037 It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
Ses04F_script02_1_M038 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
Ses04F_script02_1_M039 where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses04F_script02_1_M040 Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
Ses04F_script02_2_M000 Well, so what do you think?
Ses04F_script02_2_M019 Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses04F_script02_2_M020 It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?
Ses04F_script02_2_M021 That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.
Ses04F_script02_2_M023 You want me to get some champagne?
Ses04F_script02_2_M040 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses04F_script02_2_M041 No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses04F_script02_2_M043 Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
Ses04F_script02_2_M044 I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.
Ses04F_script02_2_M046 Well look at what we got here.
Ses04F_script02_2_M047 It's not champagne.
Ses04F_script03_1_M006 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses04F_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise.
Ses04F_script03_1_M008 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses04F_script03_1_M009 Don't say that, my darling.
Ses04F_script03_1_M017 Well who knows?
Ses04F_script03_1_M027 Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
Ses04F_script03_1_M028 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
Ses04F_script03_1_M029 Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses04F_script03_1_M030 How long did that row last?
Ses04F_script03_1_M031 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
Ses04F_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses04F_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses04F_script03_2_M003 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses04F_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses04F_script03_2_M006 What of it?
Ses04F_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses04F_script03_2_M008 That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses04F_script03_2_M010 I'll have some myself, I think.
Ses04F_script03_2_M014 Really, Amanda.
Ses04F_script03_2_M015 Nothing.
Ses04F_script03_2_M016 Going somewhere, my dear?
Ses04F_script03_2_M024 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses04F_script03_2_M027 I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses04F_script03_2_M031 Very good idea.  I will.
Ses04F_script03_2_M034 There are people downstairs I suppose.
Ses04F_script03_2_M035 This is no time of year for Tunis.
Ses04F_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses04F_script03_2_M039 Amanda, listen.
Ses04F_script03_2_M040 Very amusing.
Ses04F_script03_2_M041 You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses04F_script03_2_M042 You're not going like this.
Ses04F_script03_2_M043 You're not.
Ses04F_script03_2_M044 Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.
Ses04F_script03_2_M045 You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.
Ses04M_impro01_M000 Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.
Ses04M_impro01_M003 Yes, I do.
Ses04M_impro01_M018 It's not rocket science.
Ses04M_impro01_M024 Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.
Ses04M_impro02_M000 It's only going to be a year.
Ses04M_impro02_M008 There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.
Ses04M_impro03_M002 Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?
Ses04M_impro03_M005 Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.
Ses04M_impro03_M006 She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...
Ses04M_impro03_M007 Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.
Ses04M_impro03_M008 Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.
Ses04M_impro03_M009 But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of
Ses04M_impro03_M011 Okay. Well there you go.
Ses04M_impro03_M015 Barefoot?
Ses04M_impro03_M017 Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--
Ses04M_impro03_M019 It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--
Ses04M_impro03_M020 Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-
Ses04M_impro03_M021 Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-
Ses04M_impro03_M022 Yeah, yeah.
Ses04M_impro03_M023 Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.
Ses04M_impro03_M024 But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.
Ses04M_impro03_M025 And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.
Ses04M_impro03_M026 She's okay with it.
Ses04M_impro03_M028 Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.
Ses04M_impro03_M029 All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.
Ses04M_impro03_M030 Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.
Ses04M_impro03_M031 So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--
Ses04M_impro04_M004 there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.
Ses04M_impro04_M020 Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?
Ses04M_impro04_M021 That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.
Ses04M_impro04_M022 Yours.  I don't--
Ses04M_impro05_M008 fifty dollars?
Ses04M_impro05_M009 fifty dollars. No way, no.
Ses04M_impro05_M010 I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.
Ses04M_impro05_M011 You understand?
Ses04M_impro05_M014 No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--
Ses04M_impro05_M015 You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.
Ses04M_impro05_M016 You--
Ses04M_impro05_M017 No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.
Ses04M_impro05_M018 Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.
Ses04M_impro05_M022 Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--
Ses04M_impro05_M026 but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.
Ses04M_impro05_M038 Please.
Ses04M_impro05_M039 I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.
Ses04M_impro05_M044 Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.
Ses04M_impro05_M045 So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?
Ses04M_impro06_M000 Thanks.
Ses04M_impro06_M001 I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,
Ses04M_impro06_M002 a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.
Ses04M_impro06_M003 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_M004 Thanks.
Ses04M_impro06_M005 I just -- it's just not fair.
Ses04M_impro06_M006 I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they
Ses04M_impro06_M007 feel the same way everybody else does.
Ses04M_impro06_M008 [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.
Ses04M_impro06_M009 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_M010 Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--
Ses04M_impro06_M011 This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.
Ses04M_impro06_M012 I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -
Ses04M_impro06_M013 there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.
Ses04M_impro06_M014 I don't know what to do.
Ses04M_impro06_M015 I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.
Ses04M_impro06_M016 I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.
Ses04M_impro06_M017 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_M018 I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.
Ses04M_impro06_M019 Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.
Ses04M_impro06_M020 I know.
Ses04M_impro07_M000 Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..
Ses04M_impro07_M001 I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_M002 Yeah, yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_M003 I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but
Ses04M_impro07_M004 it's a really good school.  So
Ses04M_impro07_M007 Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.
Ses04M_impro07_M008 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_M009 And, uh-
Ses04M_impro07_M010 Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school
Ses04M_impro07_M011 and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-
Ses04M_impro07_M012 I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program.
Ses04M_impro07_M013 So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro07_M014 Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school
Ses04M_impro07_M015 And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome
Ses04M_impro07_M020 umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses
Ses04M_impro07_M021 find out all this stuff.  And- and I don't know.  I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm.
Ses04M_impro07_M025 Ouch.  That's, um -- oh, wow.
Ses04M_impro07_M026 No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --
Ses04M_impro07_M029 I'll go to basketball games.
Ses04M_impro07_M030 Maybe some golf matches.
Ses04M_impro07_M032 I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.
Ses04M_impro07_M035 No, I'm not going to go to a football game.
Ses04M_impro07_M036 Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.
Ses04M_impro07_M037 I do -- I will need to get a gun-
Ses04M_impro07_M040 Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean
Ses04M_impro07_M041 I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife
Ses04M_impro07_M042 'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus
Ses04M_impro07_M043 Well I need to defend myself from
Ses04M_impro08_M001 Are you sure you didn't make them?
Ses04M_impro08_M004 Okay.
Ses04M_impro08_M005 Umm, Miss Aruckman
Ses04M_impro08_M006 I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.
Ses04M_impro08_M008 So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.
Ses04M_impro08_M010 All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.
Ses04M_impro08_M011 What I can
Ses04M_impro08_M012 What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form
Ses04M_impro08_M013 which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.
Ses04M_impro08_M017 A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.
Ses04M_impro08_M019 Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.
Ses04M_impro08_M020 I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.
Ses04M_impro08_M021 Sure.
Ses04M_impro08_M022 You're welcome.
Ses04M_impro08_M023 No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um
Ses04M_impro08_M024 You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um
Ses04M_impro08_M025 Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.
Ses04M_impro08_M026 God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever
Ses04M_impro08_M027 if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.
Ses04M_impro08_M028 Alright. Take Care.
Ses04M_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses04M_script01_1_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses04M_script01_1_M013 We've gotta say it to him.
Ses04M_script01_1_M014 For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses04M_script01_1_M018 Going to ask her to marry me.
Ses04M_script01_1_M021 Well, then you know it's not only my business.
Ses04M_script01_1_M022 Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses04M_script01_1_M026 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses04M_script01_1_M031 Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.
Ses04M_script01_1_M032 Yeah, let's keep going.
Ses04M_script01_1_M034 father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.
Ses04M_script01_1_M037 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses04M_script01_1_M038 Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.
Ses04M_script01_1_M040 Yes, on this I would.
Ses04M_script01_1_M041 Then you help me stay here.
Ses04M_script01_2_M000 Oh, God, line.
Ses04M_script01_2_M005 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses04M_script01_2_M006 Well so what?
Ses04M_script01_2_M007 Line.
Ses04M_script01_2_M019 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses04M_script01_3_M022 Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.
Ses04M_script01_3_M023 I don't know where to start.
Ses04M_script01_3_M024 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
Ses04M_script01_3_M025 Well I lost them.
Ses04M_script01_3_M026 Just about all.
Ses04M_script01_3_M027 It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
Ses04M_script01_3_M028 For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses04M_script01_3_M030 And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,
Ses04M_script01_3_M031 a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.
Ses04M_script01_3_M032 There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
Ses04M_script01_3_M033 because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;
Ses04M_script01_3_M034 to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.
Ses04M_script01_3_M035 You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.
Ses04M_script01_3_M037 Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.
Ses04M_script02_1_M001 Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?
Ses04M_script02_1_M002 Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?
Ses04M_script02_1_M003 How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.
Ses04M_script02_1_M005 Whose is it?
Ses04M_script02_1_M008 I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
Ses04M_script02_1_M009 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
Ses04M_script02_1_M012 You want my jacket?
Ses04M_script02_1_M014 Right.
Ses04M_script02_1_M015 That's my point, too.
Ses04M_script02_1_M018 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses04M_script02_1_M020 There's mystery here and magic.
Ses04M_script02_1_M021 Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.
Ses04M_script02_1_M022 Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.
Ses04M_script02_1_M023 There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
Ses04M_script02_1_M028 no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
Ses04M_script02_1_M029 Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;
Ses04M_script02_1_M030 just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
Ses04M_script02_1_M031 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
Ses04M_script02_1_M032 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
Ses04M_script02_1_M033 Well so what did you think?
Ses04M_script02_2_M000 Well so what'd you think?
Ses04M_script02_2_M001 What I said.
Ses04M_script02_2_M006 Well what's bugging you?
Ses04M_script02_2_M007 There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.
Ses04M_script02_2_M020 Wait a minute, I've got it.
Ses04M_script02_2_M021 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.
Ses04M_script02_2_M029 Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.
Ses04M_script02_2_M031 And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
Ses04M_script02_2_M034 No, I know, me neither.
Ses04M_script02_2_M037 No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses04M_script02_2_M039 Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
Ses04M_script02_2_M040 I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.
Ses04M_script02_2_M041 Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses04M_script03_1_M003 We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?
Ses04M_script03_1_M004 I don't care, then.
Ses04M_script03_1_M006 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses04M_script03_1_M007 With the mo- with the most perfect poise?
Ses04M_script03_1_M010 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
Ses04M_script03_1_M012 You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.
Ses04M_script03_1_M013 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses04M_script03_1_M016 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses04M_script03_1_M021 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses04M_script03_1_M025 Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses04M_script03_1_M028 Line?
Ses04M_script03_1_M029 How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?
Ses04M_script03_1_M033 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses04M_script03_2_M001 I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses04M_script03_2_M008 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?
Ses04M_script03_2_M009 Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_M010 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses04M_script03_2_M011 What of it?
Ses04M_script03_2_M012 What about me?
Ses04M_script03_2_M013 That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses04M_script03_2_M014 So am I; bored stiff.
Ses04M_script03_2_M020 Really, Amanda
Ses04M_script03_2_M021 Nothing.
Ses04M_script03_2_M022 Going out somewhere, my dear?
Ses04M_script03_2_M024 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
Ses04M_script03_2_M025 Yes, it is.
Ses04M_script03_2_M026 Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_M027 It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses04M_script03_2_M028 Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_M029 Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.
Ses04M_script03_2_M030 They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses04M_script03_2_M031 They snap.
Ses04M_script03_2_M033 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?
Ses04M_script03_2_M034 You must have had a riotous time.
Ses04M_script03_2_M035 No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.
Ses04M_script03_2_M036 I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses04M_script03_2_M038 Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?
Ses04M_script03_2_M040 Very good idea.  I will
Ses04M_script03_2_M041 You better turn that off I think.
Ses04M_script03_2_M043 There are people downstairs, I suppose
Ses04M_script03_2_M046 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses04M_script03_2_M047 Turn it off.
Ses04M_script03_2_M048 Listen--
Ses04M_script03_2_M049 You're a vile tempered, loosed living
Ses04M_script03_2_M050 wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.
Ses04M_script03_2_M051 You're not going like this.
Ses04M_script03_2_M052 No, you're not.
Ses04M_script03_2_M053 Shut up. Shut up.
Ses04M_script03_2_M054 You're a mean, evil minded
Ses04M_script03_2_M055 little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.
Ses04M_script03_2_M056 Whore.
Ses05F_impro01_M000 ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from.
Ses05F_impro01_M003 Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.
Ses05F_impro02_M000 What is it?
Ses05F_impro02_M004 You got called up.
Ses05F_impro02_M005 I thought you said this wasn't going to happen for at least a year.
Ses05F_impro02_M010 Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?
Ses05F_impro02_M014 I don't understand why they would just do something like this?
Ses05F_impro02_M015 It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.
Ses05F_impro02_M024 I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.
Ses05F_impro02_M025 It's not fair.
Ses05F_impro02_M026 Why has to be you?  There's all those other people.  Somebody else can go instead.  It's not right.
Ses05F_impro02_M029 I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.
Ses05F_impro02_M031 I jus-
Ses05F_impro02_M032 I don't know.
Ses05F_impro02_M033 Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say.
Ses05F_impro02_M034 Yeah, we'll call them.  We'll figure something out.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You're right.
Ses05F_impro02_M035 I know.
Ses05F_impro02_M036 All the time, every day, every day.  They have e-mail over there and stuff like that, right? I can send you pictures.
Ses05F_impro02_M041 I love you.
Ses05F_impro03_M000 What?
Ses05F_impro03_M001 Come on, what?
Ses05F_impro03_M003 No way.
Ses05F_impro03_M005 No way, when? when,when, When did it happen?
Ses05F_impro03_M006 Oh my gosh.
Ses05F_impro03_M007 And you actually said yes.  I can't believe it.  I never thought you would get married.
Ses05F_impro03_M008 Oh my gosh.
Ses05F_impro03_M009 Oh absolutely.
Ses05F_impro03_M010 Well, we always said we'd be in our thirtieth when we got married. And we were going to get married to each other if we didn't by then
Ses05F_impro03_M011 Thirty nine, yeah.  I can't believe it.  So you broke our pact. Thanks a lot.
Ses05F_impro03_M012 Thanks a lot.  Well, okay, you've got to tell me the details.  What did he say?  Where was it?  What happened?
Ses05F_impro03_M013 Okay.  That's okay, spontaneous is great.  Spontaneous is awesome.
Ses05F_impro03_M020 Am I in it?
Ses05F_impro03_M027 Cool, perfect.  Another Chicagoite, got to love it.
Ses05F_impro03_M030 [LAUGHTER] I am sil
Ses05F_impro03_M031 And now you're getting married.
Ses05F_impro03_M032 That is amazing.  You must be so excited.  Did you tell your mom?
Ses05F_impro03_M033 Oh, did she cry?
Ses05F_impro03_M035 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro03_M036 you.. I can't believe it.  I'm so happy for you.  This is exactly what you wanted.  It's your dream come true.
Ses05F_impro03_M037 The exact right guy, I fully approve.  He's a wonderful guy.  We have a great time.  He can drink.  That's awesome.
Ses05F_impro03_M038 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro03_M039 Of course, of course she will ... of course she will.  Yeah, don't go and disappear like everyone else after they get married and I never see them again.  That'll make me mad.  You don't want to make me mad.  You know how I get when I get mad.
Ses05F_impro03_M040 Exactly.
Ses05F_impro03_M041 Exactly, "laugh".
Ses05F_impro03_M043 Oh, thanks. move here before you get married [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro03_M044 Perfect, okay, good. "sigh"
Ses05F_impro03_M045 I don't feel so bad then.  Well, I'm excited for you.
Ses05F_impro03_M046 I can't believe it.
Ses05F_impro03_M049 So I was one of the first ones? That makes me feel so important.
Ses05F_impro03_M050 Oh yeah, of course.
Ses05F_impro03_M051 I think so, too.  Are you going to get a house or-
Ses05F_impro03_M057 yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_M058 yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_M060 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro03_M061 Oh, thanks.  I'll need it.
Ses05F_impro03_M062 Oh thanks, you're too nice
Ses05F_impro03_M063 just being polite now
Ses05F_impro03_M064 because I am not getting married.
Ses05F_impro03_M065 Exactly, [LAUGHTER] I think that'll go over great, don't you?
Ses05F_impro03_M066 That's what girls like, right?
Ses05F_impro03_M067 Would you mind popping out a few for me?
Ses05F_impro03_M068 That'd be great, thanks.
Ses05F_impro04_M000 Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.
Ses05F_impro04_M001 Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?
Ses05F_impro04_M003 I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.
Ses05F_impro04_M004 Nothing's impossible.
Ses05F_impro04_M005 You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and
Ses05F_impro04_M007 No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.
Ses05F_impro04_M008 and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.
Ses05F_impro04_M009 Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.
Ses05F_impro04_M010 [GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--
Ses05F_impro04_M011 Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.
Ses05F_impro04_M012 Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?
Ses05F_impro04_M013 Have you?  There's got to be something else.
Ses05F_impro04_M015 If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.
Ses05F_impro04_M016 Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.
Ses05F_impro04_M017 Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.
Ses05F_impro04_M020 It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-
Ses05F_impro04_M022 Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.
Ses05F_impro04_M024 You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.
Ses05F_impro04_M025 You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.
Ses05F_impro04_M026 But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.
Ses05F_impro04_M027 And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?
Ses05F_impro04_M028 I mean are you going in for interviews?
Ses05F_impro04_M029 Are you presenting-
Ses05F_impro04_M030 putting your best foot forward? or you
Ses05F_impro04_M031 Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?
Ses05F_impro04_M032 Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?
Ses05F_impro04_M033 Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?
Ses05F_impro04_M034 Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?
Ses05F_impro04_M035 Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?
Ses05F_impro04_M036 Of course.
Ses05F_impro04_M037 Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.
Ses05F_impro04_M038 So what's the something else?
Ses05F_impro04_M039 You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.
Ses05F_impro04_M040 If I- If you- Will you stick with it?
Ses05F_impro04_M041 Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.
Ses05F_impro04_M042 But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?
Ses05F_impro04_M043 You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro05_M000 Okay, what flight were you on?
Ses05F_impro05_M001 On what airline?
Ses05F_impro05_M002 From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?
Ses05F_impro05_M003 So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.
Ses05F_impro05_M004 Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-
Ses05F_impro05_M005 It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-
Ses05F_impro05_M006 But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh
Ses05F_impro05_M007 I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.
Ses05F_impro05_M008 Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.
Ses05F_impro05_M009 Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?
Ses05F_impro05_M010 Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?
Ses05F_impro05_M012 Are you sure?
Ses05F_impro05_M014 All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?
Ses05F_impro05_M015 Sentimental value.
Ses05F_impro05_M016 Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.
Ses05F_impro05_M017 No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.
Ses05F_impro05_M018 Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?
Ses05F_impro05_M019 Well,
Ses05F_impro05_M022 Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.
Ses05F_impro05_M023 Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?
Ses05F_impro05_M025 Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?
Ses05F_impro05_M030 Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?
Ses05F_impro05_M031 Well, my hands are really tied then.
Ses05F_impro05_M032 Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--
Ses05F_impro05_M033 Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?
Ses05F_impro05_M034 Uh, so it was really heavy.
Ses05F_impro05_M036 I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.
Ses05F_impro05_M037 Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.
Ses05F_impro05_M039 Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-
Ses05F_impro05_M040 makes up?
Ses05F_impro05_M041 The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.
Ses05F_impro05_M048 Right.
Ses05F_impro05_M050 And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.
Ses05F_impro05_M051 So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?
Ses05F_impro05_M052 Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.
Ses05F_impro05_M053 You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro06_M001 Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?
Ses05F_impro06_M002 That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?
Ses05F_impro06_M003 I am so sorry,  It's-
Ses05F_impro06_M004 It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?
Ses05F_impro06_M005 Absolutely, absolutely.
Ses05F_impro06_M006 It's the think
Ses05F_impro06_M007 There's no reason for it.
Ses05F_impro06_M008 Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?
Ses05F_impro06_M009 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M010 Is he an actor too, or-?
Ses05F_impro06_M011 Yes of course, of course.
Ses05F_impro06_M012 Was he very close to his family?
Ses05F_impro06_M013 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M014 Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.
Ses05F_impro06_M017 Is there a funeral planned? or-
Ses05F_impro06_M018 Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.
Ses05F_impro06_M019 No problem.
Ses05F_impro06_M020 Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.
Ses05F_impro06_M021 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M022 Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.
Ses05F_impro06_M023 That's the best way to put it.
Ses05F_impro06_M024 Absolutely.
Ses05F_impro06_M025 Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.
Ses05F_impro07_M000 what
Ses05F_impro07_M001 Shut up.  What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please
Ses05F_impro07_M002 Oh, sweet.
Ses05F_impro07_M003 So you're not going to leave me.
Ses05F_impro07_M004 oh, good good good good good good.
Ses05F_impro07_M005 Are you going to live on campus?  Where are you going to live?
Ses05F_impro07_M006 Uh! stay over here.  Like travel to school. because you are so close to me
Ses05F_impro07_M007 Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right,  right.  Maybe we should get a place together.
Ses05F_impro07_M008 That'll be awesome.
Ses05F_impro07_M009 I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so.
Ses05F_impro07_M011 But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.
Ses05F_impro07_M012 it is going to be so much fun. Yes.
Ses05F_impro07_M013 Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.
Ses05F_impro07_M014 Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C..
Ses05F_impro07_M015 You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.
Ses05F_impro07_M016 Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.
Ses05F_impro07_M017 That'll be great. That'll be great.
Ses05F_impro07_M018 We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?
Ses05F_impro07_M019 Yeah, me either.
Ses05F_impro07_M020 [garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun.
Ses05F_impro07_M021 You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though.
Ses05F_impro07_M024 Woo- I I do.
Ses05F_impro07_M025 I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you.
Ses05F_impro07_M026 You're a wild and crazy woman.
Ses05F_impro07_M027 Uh huh, it will be awesome.
Ses05F_impro07_M029 living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.
Ses05F_impro07_M030 Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Ses05F_impro07_M031 Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
Ses05F_impro07_M032 Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have-
Ses05F_impro07_M033 That's a good idea.
Ses05F_impro07_M034 Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow-
Ses05F_impro07_M035 Good.  We'll have to have one soon, you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months.
Ses05F_impro07_M036 Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage]
Ses05F_impro08_M004 This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me.
Ses05F_impro08_M005 Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being.
Ses05F_impro08_M007 Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.
Ses05F_impro08_M013 Okay, great, go ahead.
Ses05F_impro08_M016 No, No, No, I am grateful.
Ses05F_impro08_M018 Did they take-
Ses05F_impro08_M019 Yes, yes, exactly.
Ses05F_impro08_M020 Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?
Ses05F_impro08_M022 Right.
Ses05F_impro08_M025 That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.
Ses05F_impro08_M026 thank you, what's the number?
Ses05F_impro08_M027 three two three
Ses05F_impro08_M028 six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much.
Ses05F_impro08_M030 It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely
Ses05F_impro08_M031 You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses05F_script01_1_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses05F_script01_1_M002 Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.
Ses05F_script01_1_M003 I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
Ses05F_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05F_script01_1_M005 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
Ses05F_script01_1_M006 I guess, he is.
Ses05F_script01_1_M007 I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses05F_script01_1_M008 Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses05F_script01_1_M009 You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
Ses05F_script01_1_M013 For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!
Ses05F_script01_1_M016 You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?
Ses05F_script01_1_M018 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses05F_script01_1_M025 To hell with that!
Ses05F_script01_1_M035 The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
Ses05F_script01_2_M000 Why does that bother you?
Ses05F_script01_2_M001 Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.
Ses05F_script01_2_M002 What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.
Ses05F_script01_2_M016 What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!
Ses05F_script01_2_M017 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses05F_script01_3_M000 I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?
Ses05F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses05F_script01_3_M005 Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses05F_script01_3_M006 How did you know?
Ses05F_script01_3_M008 Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!
Ses05F_script01_3_M009 I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.
Ses05F_script01_3_M010 You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.
Ses05F_script01_3_M016 Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.
Ses05F_script01_3_M017 Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses05F_script01_3_M021 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses05F_script01_3_M023 It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-
Ses05F_script01_3_M024 Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.
Ses05F_script01_3_M025 Yeah.  I lost them.
Ses05F_script01_3_M026 just about all.
Ses05F_script01_3_M027 Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-
Ses05F_script01_3_M028 for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.
Ses05F_script01_3_M029 I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.
Ses05F_script01_3_M030 I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.
Ses05F_script01_3_M031 And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-
Ses05F_script01_3_M032 but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?
Ses05F_script01_3_M033 And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.
Ses05F_script01_3_M034 And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.
Ses05F_script01_3_M035 It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.
Ses05F_script01_3_M036 And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and
Ses05F_script01_3_M037 It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!
Ses05F_script01_3_M039 I I want you now, Annie.
Ses05F_script01_3_M040 Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!
Ses05F_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--
Ses05F_script02_1_M001 actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?
Ses05F_script02_1_M002 Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?
Ses05F_script02_1_M003 Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.
Ses05F_script02_1_M009 Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?
Ses05F_script02_1_M010 I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.
Ses05F_script02_1_M011 [LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around
Ses05F_script02_1_M012 you want my jacket?
Ses05F_script02_1_M014 Right.
Ses05F_script02_1_M018 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.
Ses05F_script02_1_M019 Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.
Ses05F_script02_1_M020 Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.
Ses05F_script02_1_M021 This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah
Ses05F_script02_1_M023 Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.
Ses05F_script02_1_M024 There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.
Ses05F_script02_1_M029 Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?
Ses05F_script02_1_M030 Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.
Ses05F_script02_1_M031 Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.
Ses05F_script02_1_M032 It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.
Ses05F_script02_1_M033 They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.
Ses05F_script02_1_M034 Well, So what do you think?
Ses05F_script02_2_M000 Well, so?  What do you think?
Ses05F_script02_2_M002 It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses05F_script02_2_M003 I am not the only one, look at all these people.
Ses05F_script02_2_M005 Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?
Ses05F_script02_2_M010 Well We will see them this year.
Ses05F_script02_2_M016 Wait a minute, I got it.
Ses05F_script02_2_M018 Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?
Ses05F_script02_2_M019 You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses05F_script02_2_M020 Take off our shoes?
Ses05F_script02_2_M025 What.  Welcome to the human race.
Ses05F_script02_2_M031 No, I know me either.
Ses05F_script02_2_M032 Maybe if you are with somebody else too?
Ses05F_script02_2_M033 No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses05F_script02_2_M035 Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.
Ses05F_script02_2_M036 I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.
Ses05F_script02_2_M037 Well, look what we have got here.
Ses05F_script02_2_M040 Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses05F_script02_2_M041 Or not.
Ses05F_script03_1_M000 Good God.
Ses05F_script03_1_M001 I wonder.
Ses05F_script03_1_M005 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses05F_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise.
Ses05F_script03_1_M011 What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
Ses05F_script03_1_M013 All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.
Ses05F_script03_1_M014 Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].
Ses05F_script03_1_M015 Who knows?
Ses05F_script03_1_M016 No, that fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses05F_script03_1_M017 It all depends on how well we played.
Ses05F_script03_1_M018 Yes, yes, with all his might.
Ses05F_script03_1_M019 No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.
Ses05F_script03_1_M020 no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --
Ses05F_script03_1_M021 enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses05F_script03_1_M022 Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses05F_script03_1_M024 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses05F_script03_1_M025 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
Ses05F_script03_1_M026 Horrible thing, I hate it.
Ses05F_script03_1_M027 How long did that row last?
Ses05F_script03_1_M028 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses05F_script03_1_M029 Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses05F_script03_1_M030 Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses05F_script03_1_M031 [LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.
Ses05F_script03_1_M032 Oh, we were very much younger then.
Ses05F_script03_1_M033 Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses05F_script03_2_M004 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?
Ses05F_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses05F_script03_2_M008 Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses05F_script03_2_M009 So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?
Ses05F_script03_2_M010 I'll have a little I think.
Ses05F_script03_2_M013 You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
Ses05F_script03_2_M014 Really, Amanda.
Ses05F_script03_2_M016 Oh, that reply has broken my heart.
Ses05F_script03_2_M019 It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05F_script03_2_M022 They snap.
Ses05F_script03_2_M024 Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
Ses05F_script03_2_M025 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.
Ses05F_script03_2_M026 You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.
Ses05F_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.
Ses05F_script03_2_M038 Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_M039 Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_M040 Amanda-- Listen- Listen-
Ses05F_script03_2_M041 Very music- amusing indeed.
Ses05F_script03_2_M042 You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.
Ses05F_script03_2_M043 Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.
Ses05M_impro01_M005 I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.
Ses05M_impro01_M015 Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.
Ses05M_impro02_M000 Sweetheart, I've got to tell you something.  I just got a call.  I'm going to Iraq.
Ses05M_impro02_M001 I know it's really crappy timing, but I don't have a choice.
Ses05M_impro02_M007 I don't have a choice.  I have to go.  If I don't go, they'll come and take me.
Ses05M_impro02_M010 I know.
Ses05M_impro02_M011 I don't want to -- the kids.  You've got to take care of them.  You've got- you've got to-
Ses05M_impro02_M012 tell them about me and show them pictures of me and everything like that, because they are not going to see me for such a long time.  And it's such an important time and I just don't want to miss it.
Ses05M_impro02_M013 I don't have -- I know.  What are we gonna- What are we- just run away?  What can I do?  Where can we go?
Ses05M_impro02_M018 I know.  But I'll-I'll send the pictures all the time and I'll write them emails and you can read them the emails that I send them.
Ses05M_impro02_M019 I'm gonna be in Bagdad, just doing security.
Ses05M_impro02_M021 I just want to be honest with you.  I don't want you to .
Ses05M_impro02_M022 but, it's gonna be fine.  I'm gonna be fine.  You know I'm good at this.  I can do this.  That's why I trained all this time.  I'm good at this.  Okay?
Ses05M_impro02_M023 I know.  I know.  I know.  But, you know what?  That doesn't mean it's gonna be me; does it?
Ses05M_impro02_M024 No.  It doesn't.  And you can't think like that.
Ses05M_impro02_M025 I don't want you to -- I know.  I know. You can't worry about me.  You've got to worry about the kids.  And you've got to take care of the kids for me.  Okay?  Take care of the kids for me; all right?
Ses05M_impro02_M027 I'll miss you, baby.
Ses05M_impro02_M028 All- I'll write you everyday, all the time.  And I'll send you pictures and you send me pictures. I know We've got email out there.  We've got email and I can see stuff and you can send me stuff all the time.  Okay?
Ses05M_impro02_M029 yeah yeah yeah.
Ses05M_impro02_M030 You you record every second.  You record every second because I want to see it all.  Okay?
Ses05M_impro03_M000 Guess what?
Ses05M_impro03_M001 I did it, I asked her to marry me.
Ses05M_impro03_M002 Yes, I did it.
Ses05M_impro03_M003 Oh my god, it was just last weekend.
Ses05M_impro03_M004 She--,well, she said yes, first of all, let me say that right off the bat. Well, I would like to assume, too.  But you never know these things, right?
Ses05M_impro03_M006 I did it up at Yosemite.  We went camping right like we usually do.  You know we go camping up there all the time.  But, um- the waterfalls had died down a little bit, you know. And so uh- we-I had her climb up.

Ses05M_impro03_M008 and you can climb it and it's covered in algae you know. So, I wanted her to climb it to go take a picture, like, back in this little waterfall area, and she got back there and she took her picture. And then, I had her come back.  And I was going to do the same thing.
Ses05M_impro03_M009 Well, instead I climb up on the rock and like I- I didn't do it -- well, I did it on purpose. I made it look like I accidentally did it.  I slipped down into this pool of water, right?  And she freaks out because I slide all the way down this rock.  And um-

Ses05M_impro05_M022 Thank you
Ses05M_impro06_M000 I just got some bad news.
Ses05M_impro06_M001 My friend, Shotty, passed away.
Ses05M_impro06_M002 The end, he's been sick for awhile.  He had cancer.
Ses05M_impro06_M003 Yeah.  It's just, I never thought it would actually happen, you know? I mean- He's such a fighter and he's always so positive about everything.
Ses05M_impro06_M004 You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --
Ses05M_impro06_M005 he wanted to travel, you know.  And he's so talented.  Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life.
Ses05M_impro06_M006 He was a designer, you know.  But he did everything. You know, He painted and he- and he did costume design, he did set design, he did lighting, he was --
Ses05M_impro06_M007 he just did everything.  He was literally, literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life.
Ses05M_impro06_M008 And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.
Ses05M_impro06_M009 I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then --
Ses05M_impro06_M010 you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time.
Ses05M_impro06_M011 And now I don't have that person anymore, you know.  And it's -- -- it's just, you.
Ses05M_impro06_M012 You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -
Ses05M_impro06_M013 and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-
Ses05M_impro06_M014 You always think, you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen, like, it will all be better when I am older, you know?
Ses05M_impro06_M017 No, you're right.  I don't.  You're right.
Ses05M_impro06_M018 Even, yeah -- he doesn't he would never feel that way, he would never want me to feel that way.  Of course not, but that's just where I am right now and -- -- I don't know what else to do with it.

Ses05M_impro07_M018 I just want to be really close to things, you know.  I know it's not exactly the best neighborhood in the entire world. But uh-
Ses05M_impro07_M019 I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway.
Ses05M_impro07_M020 They don't live here.  They don't know, right?
Ses05M_impro07_M021 yeah.

Ses05M_impro07_M025 Yeah, yeah.  I- I don't- I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?
Ses05M_impro07_M026 You know the area better than I do.
Ses05M_impro07_M028 Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?
Ses05M_impro07_M029 I don't care. I don't care.
Ses05M_impro07_M030 yeah?
Ses05M_impro07_M031 That would be perfect.
Ses05M_impro07_M032 Really?
Ses05M_impro07_M033 Really?

Ses05M_impro07_M037 So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so.
Ses05M_impro07_M039 And yeah, well, I mean, basically I just applied for any and every possible scholarship and grant that could come by, so I can go.
Ses05M_impro07_M040 Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's gonna work out.  I'm gonna be able to pay for it, I'm gonna go, I mean, I'll have a little debt in the end.  But I don't care.
Ses05M_impro07_M041 It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true?
Ses05M_impro07_M042 Oh I know, I know.
Ses05M_impro07_M043 But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right?
Ses05M_impro07_M044 Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy.

Ses05M_impro07_M047 Great.  Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_M000 D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?
Ses05M_impro08_M001 This happens every two weeks?
Ses05M_impro08_M002 You've lost your connection.
Ses05M_impro08_M003 okay.
Ses05M_impro08_M004 Hmm.  Mmm.
Ses05M_impro08_M005 Has somebody tried to pin your site?
Ses05M_impro08_M006 Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?
Ses05M_impro08_M007 Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?
Ses05M_impro08_M008 Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --
Ses05M_impro08_M009 Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.
Ses05M_impro08_M010 Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.
Ses05M_impro08_M011 Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?
Ses05M_impro08_M012 Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.
Ses05M_impro08_M013 Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?

Ses05M_impro08_M017 Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.
Ses05M_impro08_M018 Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?
Ses05M_impro08_M019 It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.
Ses05M_impro08_M020 Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --

Ses05M_impro08_M027 All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.
Ses05M_impro08_M028 All right.  Bye, bye.
Ses05M_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05M_script01_1_M011 Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?
Ses05M_script01_1_M013 For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!
Ses05M_script01_1_M016 You know.
Ses05M_script01_1_M017 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses05M_script01_1_M020 Oh, so it isn't just my business?
Ses05M_script01_1_M021 You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.
Ses05M_script01_1_M022 Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses05M_script01_1_M023 She is not Larry's girl!
Ses05M_script01_1_M025 To hell with that!
Ses05M_script01_1_M028 So what?  I'm not fast with women.
Ses05M_script01_1_M032 I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.
Ses05M_script01_1_M033 But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.
Ses05M_script01_1_M034 I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.
Ses05M_script01_1_M035 I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses05M_script01_1_M036 Yes.  On this, I would.
Ses05M_script01_1_M037 Well, you help me stay here.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M002 About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M003 I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M004 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M005 Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M019 Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M020 She's not Larry's girl.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M022 what to hell with that!
Ses05M_script01_1b_M031 I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M032 But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M033 I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M035 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M036 Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M040 Well, I am thinking like that.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M041 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses05M_script01_2_M000 Why does that bother you?
Ses05M_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses05M_script01_2_M003 Why do you think he's even thinking that?
Ses05M_script01_2_M015 What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses05M_script01_2_M016 What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?
Ses05M_script01_3_M001 So, you're not sorry I came?
Ses05M_script01_3_M003 Well-
Ses05M_script01_3_M010 You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.
Ses05M_script01_3_M013 You felt something that far back?
Ses05M_script01_3_M016 oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?
Ses05M_script01_3_M017 Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses05M_script01_3_M019 Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.
Ses05M_script01_3_M020 No, nothing like that.
Ses05M_script01_3_M021 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.
Ses05M_script01_3_M022 I don't I don't know where to start.
Ses05M_script01_3_M023 It's so mixed up with so many other things.
Ses05M_script01_3_M025 I lost them.
Ses05M_script01_3_M026 Just about all.
Ses05M_script01_3_M027 It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.
Ses05M_script01_3_M029 I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.
Ses05M_script01_3_M030 I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.
Ses05M_script01_3_M033 It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.
Ses05M_script01_3_M036 I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.
Ses05M_script01_3_M039 And I guess that included you.
Ses05M_script01_3_M040 I want you now, Annie.
Ses05M_script01_3_M041 Oh, Annie,
Ses05M_script01_3_M042 Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
Ses05M_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?
Ses05M_script02_1_M001 What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?
Ses05M_script02_1_M002 This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.
Ses05M_script02_1_M003 The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.
Ses05M_script02_1_M005 Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.
Ses05M_script02_1_M006 How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?
Ses05M_script02_1_M007 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses05M_script02_1_M008 I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]
Ses05M_script02_1_M009 Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something
Ses05M_script02_1_M010 Do you want my jacket?
Ses05M_script02_1_M017 Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.
Ses05M_script02_1_M018 I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.
Ses05M_script02_1_M019 Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,
Ses05M_script02_1_M020 and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.
Ses05M_script02_1_M021 I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.
Ses05M_script02_1_M023 All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.
Ses05M_script02_1_M028 Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.
Ses05M_script02_1_M029 Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;
Ses05M_script02_1_M030 somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-
Ses05M_script02_1_M031 And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,
Ses05M_script02_1_M032 they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.
Ses05M_script02_1_M033 Well, so what do you think?
Ses05M_script02_2_M000 Well, so, what do you think?
Ses05M_script02_2_M001 What I was just saying.
Ses05M_script02_2_M005 uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?
Ses05M_script02_2_M016 It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?
Ses05M_script02_2_M024 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?
Ses05M_script02_2_M025 Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!
Ses05M_script02_2_M026 Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
Ses05M_script02_2_M029 Now, I know.  Me either
Ses05M_script02_2_M030 I'm trying the best I can.
Ses05M_script02_2_M031 Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?
Ses05M_script02_2_M032 No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
Ses05M_script02_2_M034 Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
Ses05M_script02_2_M035 I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.
Ses05M_script02_2_M036 Oh, well look what we've got here.
Ses05M_script02_2_M037 Well, it isn't champagne.
Ses05M_script02_2_M040 Or not.
Ses05M_script03_1_M001 I wonder.
Ses05M_script03_1_M003 We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?
Ses05M_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses05M_script03_1_M006 Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.
Ses05M_script03_1_M007 With the worst- with the most perfect poise?
Ses05M_script03_1_M008 Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--
Ses05M_script03_1_M009 things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses05M_script03_1_M010 Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.
Ses05M_script03_1_M011 Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.
Ses05M_script03_1_M012 Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
Ses05M_script03_1_M013 You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.
Ses05M_script03_1_M014 All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.
Ses05M_script03_1_M015 uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.
Ses05M_script03_1_M016 Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.
Ses05M_script03_1_M018 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses05M_script03_1_M020 Yes, yes, with all his might.
Ses05M_script03_1_M021 No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.
Ses05M_script03_1_M022 So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.
Ses05M_script03_1_M023 [garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses05M_script03_1_M024 I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.
Ses05M_script03_1_M025 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses05M_script03_1_M026 The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.
Ses05M_script03_1_M027 Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses05M_script03_1_M028 How long did that roue last?
Ses05M_script03_1_M029 Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?
Ses05M_script03_1_M030 [LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses05M_script03_1_M031 Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses05M_script03_1_M032 I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
Ses05M_script03_1_M033 We were very much younger then.
Ses05M_script03_2_M008 Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses05M_script03_2_M009 Me, too, bored stiff.
Ses05M_script03_2_M010 Do you want some brandy?
Ses05M_script03_2_M011 I think I'll have a little.
Ses05M_script03_2_M015 Amanda, really.
Ses05M_script03_2_M020 It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05M_script03_2_M023 They snap.
Ses05M_script03_2_M024 So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
Ses05M_script03_2_M025 You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?
Ses05M_script03_2_M026 I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.
Ses05M_script03_2_M027 I am not the slightest bit drunk.
Ses05M_script03_2_M028 I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.
Ses05M_script03_2_M029 Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?
Ses05M_script03_2_M030 You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.
Ses05M_script03_2_M031 You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
Ses05M_script03_2_M032 You better turn that off, I think.
Ses05M_script03_2_M033 Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.
Ses05M_script03_2_M034 Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.
Ses05M_script03_2_M035 This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses05M_script03_2_M036 I do I shall do no such thing.
Ses05M_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses05M_script03_2_M038 Turn it off!
Ses05M_script03_2_M039 Very amusing indeed.
Ses05M_script03_2_M040 Ja! Very funny.
Ses05M_script03_2_M041 You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.
Ses05M_script03_2_M042 Oh, you're not going like this.
Ses05M_script03_2_M043 [GARBAGE] No, you're not.
Ses05M_script03_2_M044 oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.
Ses05M_script03_2_M045 You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.
