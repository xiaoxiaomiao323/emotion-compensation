Ses01F_impro01_F000 Excuse me.
Ses01F_impro01_F001 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro01_F002 Is there a problem?
Ses01F_impro01_F005 Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.
Ses01F_impro01_F012 That's out of control.
Ses01F_impro01_F014 Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?
Ses01F_impro01_M011 I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_M013 Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.
Ses01F_impro02_F000 Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
Ses01F_impro02_F001 Yeah.  I know.
Ses01F_impro02_F002 I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...
Ses01F_impro02_F003 I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.
Ses01F_impro02_F004 There's people that have given more though, you know?
Ses01F_impro02_F005 I know.
Ses01F_impro02_F006 There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.
Ses01F_impro02_F008 Just, you know, kicking myself.
Ses01F_impro02_F010 things just aren't what they seem.
Ses01F_impro02_F012 If not me then, who?
Ses01F_impro02_F013 You'll videotape everything, yeah?
Ses01F_impro02_F014 Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?
Ses01F_impro02_F015 Last month--  Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_F016 I have to find sitters.
Ses01F_impro02_F017 We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.
Ses01F_impro02_F018 And your mother is close by.
Ses01F_impro02_F019 I'll send you lots of letters.
Ses01F_impro02_F020 And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.
Ses01F_impro02_M001 I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.
Ses01F_impro02_M005 I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.
Ses01F_impro02_M009 I just don't see why it has to be you.
Ses01F_impro02_M010 What am I going to do? Huh?
Ses01F_impro02_M011 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_M012 Don't you guys have access to computers over there.
Ses01F_impro02_M013 I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.
Ses01F_impro02_M014 I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?
Ses01F_impro02_M015 I know.
Ses01F_impro03_F000 Well Vegas was awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_F001 And, um, I got married.
Ses01F_impro03_F002 Yeah.  In the old town part.
Ses01F_impro03_F004 Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_F005 It was at the slot machines.
Ses01F_impro03_F006 Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.
Ses01F_impro03_F008 Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.
Ses01F_impro03_F009 But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.
Ses01F_impro03_F010 Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
Ses01F_impro03_F012 Oh.  Totally.
Ses01F_impro03_F013 I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_F015 Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now
Ses01F_impro03_F016 He likes to keep tabs, you know.
Ses01F_impro03_F017 Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Ses01F_impro03_F018 Penny slots. That's what he plays.
Ses01F_impro03_F019 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F021 Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-
Ses01F_impro03_F022 Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro03_F023 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_F024 Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
Ses01F_impro03_F025 We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet.
Ses01F_impro03_F026 She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_M000 So what's up?  What's new?
Ses01F_impro03_M001 Yeah.  I heard.
Ses01F_impro03_M003 Who did you marry?
Ses01F_impro03_M006 He turned to you and was like...
Ses01F_impro03_M007 [LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_M008 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_M009 Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?
Ses01F_impro03_M011 Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?
Ses01F_impro03_M013 Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_M014 Is that your phone?
Ses01F_impro03_M015 He loves you.
Ses01F_impro03_M016 How much did he win at the slot?
Ses01F_impro03_M019 I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.
Ses01F_impro03_M020 But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.
Ses01F_impro03_M021 like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.
Ses01F_impro03_M022 Awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_M023 [LAUGHTER] Cat babies.
Ses01F_impro03_M024 That's fair enough.
Ses01F_impro04_F000 Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?
Ses01F_impro04_F001 I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.
Ses01F_impro04_F005 He just...
Ses01F_impro04_F006 you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.
Ses01F_impro04_F009 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_F013 I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.
Ses01F_impro04_F014 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_F028 I'm not frustrated.
Ses01F_impro04_F029 Who do you think you are?
Ses01F_impro04_F030 You are so high and mighty.  I just--
Ses01F_impro04_F031 Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.
Ses01F_impro04_F032 The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.
Ses01F_impro04_F033 I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.
Ses01F_impro04_M000 Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?
Ses01F_impro04_M001 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M002 No.  There's regular jobs on there.
Ses01F_impro04_M003 Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro04_M004 I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.
Ses01F_impro04_M005 He's like a manager for a theatre.
Ses01F_impro04_M006 He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.
Ses01F_impro04_M007 You did?
Ses01F_impro04_M008 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M009 You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?
Ses01F_impro04_M010 Hmm.
Ses01F_impro04_M011 I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--
Ses01F_impro04_M012 Yeah.  Do you have a resume?
Ses01F_impro04_M013 It's kind of helpful when getting a job.
Ses01F_impro04_M014 Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.
Ses01F_impro04_M015 No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--
Ses01F_impro04_M016 Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.
Ses01F_impro04_M017 No.  But it has an outline, you know.
Ses01F_impro04_M018 I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--
Ses01F_impro04_M019 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M020 Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.
Ses01F_impro04_M021 Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.
Ses01F_impro04_M022 maybe get a car.
Ses01F_impro04_M023 I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.
Ses01F_impro04_M024 I didn't say that.
Ses01F_impro04_M025 I am riding the bus, but by choice.
Ses01F_impro04_M026 To save the environment, carpool.
Ses01F_impro04_M027 Yes.  One less car at a time.
Ses01F_impro04_M028 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro04_M031 I don't think I'm anyone.
Ses01F_impro04_M032 I- I-I didn't-- okay.
Ses01F_impro05_F008 Flight seven fourteen.
Ses01F_impro05_F009 Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?
Ses01F_impro05_F011 Is this a joke?
Ses01F_impro05_F012 Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.
Ses01F_impro05_F014 You're kidding me, this is a joke.
Ses01F_impro05_F015 Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.
Ses01F_impro05_F016 We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.
Ses01F_impro05_F017 I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.
Ses01F_impro05_F018 Do you understand who my husband is?
Ses01F_impro05_F019 If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.
Ses01F_impro05_F020 Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?
Ses01F_impro05_F021 You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.
Ses01F_impro05_F022 Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?
Ses01F_impro05_F023 Because I probably know him.
Ses01F_impro05_F024 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_F025 I don't want money, I want my clothes.
Ses01F_impro05_F026 What's your name?
Ses01F_impro05_F028 Okay.  I'll do that.
Ses01F_impro05_F029 I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.
Ses01F_impro05_F030 A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.
Ses01F_impro05_M000 Hi.  Thanks for waiting.
Ses01F_impro05_M001 Can I help you?
Ses01F_impro05_M002 Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro05_M003 Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M004 Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M005 Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.
Ses01F_impro05_M006 Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M007 all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?
Ses01F_impro05_M008 Uh-huh.
Ses01F_impro05_M009 Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--
Ses01F_impro05_M010 I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-
Ses01F_impro05_M011 we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...
Ses01F_impro05_M012 for such an inconvenience and your bag, but
Ses01F_impro05_M013 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_M014 No, no.
Ses01F_impro05_M015 No, no.  This is real.
Ses01F_impro05_M016 No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...
Ses01F_impro05_M017 this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.
Ses01F_impro05_M019 Yes.
Ses01F_impro05_M020 I know.
Ses01F_impro05_M022 Okay. Calm-
Ses01F_impro05_M023 Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really
Ses01F_impro05_M024 We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.
Ses01F_impro05_M025 It's a gift.
Ses01F_impro05_M026 You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.
Ses01F_impro05_M027 With the amount of--
Ses01F_impro05_M028 Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?
Ses01F_impro05_M029 Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--
Ses01F_impro05_M030 Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.
Ses01F_impro05_M031 Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.
Ses01F_impro05_M034 If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--
Ses01F_impro05_M035 Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...
Ses01F_impro06_F002 No.
Ses01F_impro06_F003 That's sweet.
Ses01F_impro06_F004 Thank you.
Ses01F_impro06_F005 I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.
Ses01F_impro06_F006 I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.
Ses01F_impro06_F007 So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.
Ses01F_impro06_F008 So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-
Ses01F_impro06_F009 this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.
Ses01F_impro06_F010 Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.
Ses01F_impro06_F011 And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.
Ses01F_impro06_F012 I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever.
Ses01F_impro06_F013 I don't know.
Ses01F_impro06_F014 At the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_F015 couple hours.
Ses01F_impro06_F016 I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.
Ses01F_impro06_F018 Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.
Ses01F_impro06_F019 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F020 It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.
Ses01F_impro06_F021 My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.
Ses01F_impro06_F022 She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.
Ses01F_impro06_F023 Umm. Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_F024 And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...
Ses01F_impro06_F025 But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.
Ses01F_impro06_F026 Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-
Ses01F_impro06_F027 There's another one, I can't remember.
Ses01F_impro06_F028 I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?
Ses01F_impro06_M000 I'm sorry, Joy.
Ses01F_impro06_M001 Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?
Ses01F_impro06_M002 ...pick up anything?
Ses01F_impro06_M003 You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.
Ses01F_impro06_M004 Hmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M005 Oh.  She was there?
Ses01F_impro06_M006 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M007 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_M008 How long were you there for?
Ses01F_impro06_M009 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M010 Oh really?
Ses01F_impro06_M011 You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_M012 Is it a big cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_M013 Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?
Ses01F_impro06_M014 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M015 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M016 So she wrote a lot of poetry?
Ses01F_impro07_F000 Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know.
Ses01F_impro07_F002 I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.
Ses01F_impro07_F003 Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.
Ses01F_impro07_F004 I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.
Ses01F_impro07_F005 I know. We should throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_F009 Yeah.  I'm not sure.
Ses01F_impro07_F010 Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro07_F012 So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.
Ses01F_impro07_F013 I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.
Ses01F_impro07_F016 I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.
Ses01F_impro07_M000 Did you get the letter?
Ses01F_impro07_M001 Yeah. That is so awesome.
Ses01F_impro07_M002 Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro07_M003 Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.
Ses01F_impro07_M004 Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?
Ses01F_impro07_M005 This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_M006 A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.
Ses01F_impro07_M007 I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo.
Ses01F_impro07_M008 Yeah.  Big time.
Ses01F_impro07_M009 Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?
Ses01F_impro07_M012 Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice
Ses01F_impro07_M013 That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?
Ses01F_impro07_M014 Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.
Ses01F_impro07_M015 You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.
Ses01F_impro07_M017 Yay...School's fun.
Ses01F_impro07_M018 Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.
Ses01F_impro07_M019 That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.
Ses01F_script01_1_F005 He's dreaming of him again, walking around.
Ses01F_script01_1_F015 Well I got an idea, but what's your story?
Ses01F_script01_1_F034 Just give it some more thought.
Ses01F_script01_1_F035 What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_F037 You have a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses01F_script01_1_F038 Oh.  Must you be inspired?
Ses01F_script01_1_F041 All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.
Ses01F_script01_1_F042 Just don't think like that.
Ses01F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses01F_script01_1_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses01F_script01_1_M002 Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.
Ses01F_script01_1_M003 I don't know.
Ses01F_script01_1_M004 I guess he is.
Ses01F_script01_1_M007 You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses01F_script01_1_M010 We've got to say it to him.
Ses01F_script01_1_M012 Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.
Ses01F_script01_1_M014 You know.
Ses01F_script01_1_M015 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01F_script01_1_M016 You know it's not just my business.
Ses01F_script01_1_M017 So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?
Ses01F_script01_1_M019 You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses01F_script01_1_M023 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses01F_script01_1_M024 Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.
Ses01F_script01_1_M025 And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.
Ses01F_script01_1_M034 I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.
Ses01F_script01_1_M039 On this, I would.
Ses01F_script01_1_M040 Then help me stay here.
Ses01F_script01_2_F003 He's not going to marry her.
Ses01F_script01_2_F004 It's got that about it.
Ses01F_script01_2_F005 What is going on here, Joe?
Ses01F_script01_2_F006 She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses01F_script01_2_F007 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.
Ses01F_script01_2_F008 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.
Ses01F_script01_2_F009 Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses01F_script01_2_F010 I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.
Ses01F_script01_2_F011 I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses01F_script01_2_F012 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.
Ses01F_script01_2_F013 Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.
Ses01F_script01_2_M001 Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses01F_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses01F_script01_2_M008 How do you know why she waited?
Ses01F_script01_2_M017 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses01F_script01_3_F000 You're the only one who still loves his parents.
Ses01F_script01_3_F001 It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
Ses01F_script01_3_F002 [BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses01F_script01_3_F003 I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.
Ses01F_script01_3_F004 For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.
Ses01F_script01_3_F005 And then, you.  You've been kind of...
Ses01F_script01_3_F006 Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.
Ses01F_script01_3_F007 I knew they would.
Ses01F_script01_3_F008 Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?
Ses01F_script01_3_F009 I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.
Ses01F_script01_3_F010 [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script01_3_F011 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_F012 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script01_3_F013 No. No
Ses01F_script01_3_F014 Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.
Ses01F_script01_3_F015 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses01F_script01_3_F016 You started to write me.
Ses01F_script01_3_F017 Every day since.
Ses01F_script01_3_F019 beating around the bush.
Ses01F_script01_3_F020 I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.
Ses01F_script01_3_F021 Not like that you're not.
Ses01F_script01_3_F022 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.
Ses01F_script01_3_F028 Yeah, sure.
Ses01F_script01_3_F029 How many?
Ses01F_script01_3_F030 Aw, geez.
Ses01F_script01_3_F031 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_script01_3_F035 What would I do with a fortune?
Ses01F_script01_3_M000 I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?
Ses01F_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came.
Ses01F_script01_3_M003 Well.
Ses01F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses01F_script01_3_M005 Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses01F_script01_3_M008 I love you. Annie, I love you.
Ses01F_script01_3_M009 I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.
Ses01F_script01_3_M010 Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.
Ses01F_script01_3_M015 Why didn't you let me know?
Ses01F_script01_3_M016 Give me a...
Ses01F_script01_3_M017 Give me a kiss.
Ses01F_script01_3_M019 Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.
Ses01F_script01_3_M020 I kissed you.
Ses01F_script01_3_M021 Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.
Ses01F_script01_3_M022 No it's nothing like that. It's-
Ses01F_script01_3_M023 Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.
Ses01F_script01_3_M024 I don't even know how to start.
Ses01F_script01_3_M025 It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses01F_script01_3_M026 Well I lost them.
Ses01F_script01_3_M027 Pretty much all.
Ses01F_script01_3_M028 You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?
Ses01F_script01_3_M029 Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.
Ses01F_script01_3_M030 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.
Ses01F_script01_3_M032 To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.
Ses01F_script01_3_M033 But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.
Ses01F_script01_3_M036 And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.
Ses01F_script01_3_M037 I just want you to know Annie.
Ses01F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses01F_script02_1_F004 That's not your flashlight.
Ses01F_script02_1_F006 You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.
Ses01F_script02_1_F007 How's that supposed to make me feel?
Ses01F_script02_1_F008 Yeah.
Ses01F_script02_1_F009 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script02_1_F010 I'm cold.
Ses01F_script02_1_F015 Not particularly.
Ses01F_script02_1_F024 That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_1_F025 About what?
Ses01F_script02_1_M002 Okay.  Is that, is that--
Ses01F_script02_1_M007 The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?
Ses01F_script02_1_M008 Whose is it?
Ses01F_script02_1_M009 Oh...well. Yeah, of course.
Ses01F_script02_1_M010 No.
Ses01F_script02_1_M011 Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.
Ses01F_script02_1_M013 Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?
Ses01F_script02_1_M014 Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.
Ses01F_script02_1_M015 Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?
Ses01F_script02_1_M016 God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.
Ses01F_script02_1_M020 Right.
Ses01F_script02_1_M021 Wait, that's my point, too.
Ses01F_script02_1_M023 Why not?
Ses01F_script02_1_M024 Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.
Ses01F_script02_1_M025 Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.
Ses01F_script02_1_M026 This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.
Ses01F_script02_1_M029 There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.
Ses01F_script02_1_M031 God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?
Ses01F_script02_1_M032 And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.
Ses01F_script02_1_M033 Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.
Ses01F_script02_1_M034 We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.
Ses01F_script02_1_M035 Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.
Ses01F_script02_1_M036 God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.
Ses01F_script02_1_M038 Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.
Ses01F_script02_1_M040 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.
Ses01F_script02_1_M043 So what do you think?
Ses01F_script02_1_M044 About all of that, about all I was talking about.
Ses01F_script02_2_F000 That's the wind.
Ses01F_script02_2_F001 About what?
Ses01F_script02_2_F006 Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses01F_script02_2_F008 For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.
Ses01F_script02_2_F009 Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?
Ses01F_script02_2_F010 Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.
Ses01F_script02_2_F015 I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.
Ses01F_script02_2_F016 For God's sake, this is not about fish.
Ses01F_script02_2_F017 Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.
Ses01F_script02_2_F019 You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses01F_script02_2_F022 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses01F_script02_2_F023 No.
Ses01F_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses01F_script02_2_F034 I know you are Augie, I know.
Ses01F_script02_2_F035 I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.
Ses01F_script02_2_F036 I didn't say that.
Ses01F_script02_2_F040 You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.
Ses01F_script02_2_F041 So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.
Ses01F_script02_2_F042 Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.
Ses01F_script02_2_F043 Augie, you bought refreshments.
Ses01F_script02_2_F044 I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses01F_script02_2_F045 I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.
Ses01F_script02_2_F046 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses01F_script02_2_F047 Or not.
Ses01F_script02_2_M000 Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.
Ses01F_script02_2_M001 Well, so, what do you think?
Ses01F_script02_2_M002 About what I was saying.
Ses01F_script02_2_M006 Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?
Ses01F_script02_2_M016 Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.
Ses01F_script02_2_M017 Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.
Ses01F_script02_2_M019 It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.
Ses01F_script02_2_M021 Sure.  All right.  Okay.
Ses01F_script02_2_M022 Listen, do you want to dance?
Ses01F_script02_2_M023 Do you want me to go get some champagne?
Ses01F_script02_2_M024 Do you want to take off your shoes?
Ses01F_script02_2_M026 Do you want to get married again?
Ses01F_script02_2_M033 Yes it is.
Ses01F_script02_2_M037 Maybe if you were with someone else, too.
Ses01F_script02_2_M038 I just- I know I don't make you happy.
Ses01F_script02_2_M040 You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
Ses01F_script02_2_M042 We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?
Ses01F_script02_2_M043 [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M044 And look what I got here.
Ses01F_script02_2_M046 [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M047 Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?
Ses01F_script02_2_M048 Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses01F_script02_2_M049 Or not.
Ses01F_script03_1_F005 [LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses01F_script03_1_F006 We'll behave exquisitely.
Ses01F_script03_1_F007 I think I shall do a curtsy.
Ses01F_script03_1_F010 Yes.  Meaning just that.
Ses01F_script03_1_F011 Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.
Ses01F_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses01F_script03_1_F020 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_F021 Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses01F_script03_1_F022 Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.
Ses01F_script03_1_F024 Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses01F_script03_1_F029 The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses01F_script03_1_F030 [LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_1_M005 I don't care then.
Ses01F_script03_1_M007 No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M008 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M009 With perfect poise.
Ses01F_script03_1_M010 It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
Ses01F_script03_1_M013 Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
Ses01F_script03_1_M018 Who knows?
Ses01F_script03_1_M021 Yes.  Yes with all of his might.
Ses01F_script03_1_M024 Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.
Ses01F_script03_1_M025 Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
Ses01F_script03_1_M026 Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.
Ses01F_script03_1_M034 That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses01F_script03_1_M036 [LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M037 [LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.
Ses01F_script03_2_F000 And very much sillier.
Ses01F_script03_2_F001 Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01F_script03_2_F002 Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.
Ses01F_script03_2_F004 I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses01F_script03_2_F005 Well, what of it?
Ses01F_script03_2_F013 Don't be stupid.
Ses01F_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses01F_script03_2_F015 No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses01F_script03_2_F016 Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.
Ses01F_script03_2_F017 No it isn't.
Ses01F_script03_2_F018 You shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F021 They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
Ses01F_script03_2_F022 Yes I did, quite a lot.
Ses01F_script03_2_F023 Mind your own business.
Ses01F_script03_2_F024 You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.
Ses01F_script03_2_F025 You've always had a weak head.
Ses01F_script03_2_F026 On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses01F_script03_2_F027 Oh shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F028 Shut up.
Ses01F_script03_2_F029 Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.
Ses01F_script03_2_F030 Why?
Ses01F_script03_2_F031 There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses01F_script03_2_F032 They are away in Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_F034 Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses01F_script03_2_F035 You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.
Ses01F_script03_2_F036 I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses01F_script03_2_F037 Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses01F_script03_2_F038 This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
Ses01F_script03_2_F039 Oh.  Yes I am.
Ses01F_script03_2_F040 Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.
Ses01F_script03_2_M001 However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_M002 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses01F_script03_2_M004 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses01F_script03_2_M010 I'll have a little, I think.
Ses01F_script03_2_M011 No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.
Ses01F_script03_2_M014 Really, Amanda.
Ses01F_script03_2_M016 you going out somewhere, dear?
Ses01F_script03_2_M018 Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.
Ses01F_script03_2_M019 Yes it is.
Ses01F_script03_2_M020 Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses01F_script03_2_M021 Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.
Ses01F_script03_2_M022 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.
Ses01F_script03_2_M023 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses01F_script03_2_M024 And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.
Ses01F_script03_2_M025 I think I am not in the least bit drunk.
Ses01F_script03_2_M026 I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.
Ses01F_script03_2_M027 That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.
Ses01F_script03_2_M029 Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.
Ses01F_script03_2_M030 Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.
Ses01F_script03_2_M031 This is no time of year for Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_M032 I will do no such thing.
Ses01F_script03_2_M033 Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.
Ses01F_script03_2_M034 Turn it off.
Ses01F_script03_2_M035 Amanda, listen, listen.
Ses01F_script03_2_M036 Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.
Ses01F_script03_2_M037 You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses01F_script03_2_M038 You're not going like this.
Ses01F_script03_2_M039 You're not.
Ses01F_script03_2_M040 Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses01M_impro01_F000 Next.
Ses01M_impro01_F001 My window is open.
Ses01M_impro01_F007 No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.
Ses01M_impro01_F008 It's really simple if you have a problem with it... Maybe you should--
Ses01M_impro01_F011 What do you expect me to do?
Ses01M_impro01_F012 Probably.
Ses01M_impro01_F019 Don't raise your voice with me.
Ses01M_impro01_F020 Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
Ses01M_impro01_F021 Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?

Ses01M_impro05_F017 I have some unfortunate news, uh, that your bag isn't going to be--
Ses01M_impro05_F018 --arriving any time soon.
Ses01M_impro05_F019 I'm really sorry to tell you this but...
Ses01M_impro05_F020 It's not.  I can offer you fifty dollars and a reimbursement gift cards for our airline...
Ses01M_impro05_F021 ...and your future...
Ses01M_impro05_F022 No.
Ses01M_impro05_F023 Yes.
Ses01M_impro05_F024 We've actually...
Ses01M_impro05_F025 They do as matter of fact.  We don't like to publicize it because
Ses01M_impro05_F026 people wouldn't Fly our airline.
Ses01M_impro05_F027 What was that?
Ses01M_impro05_F028 That's unfortunate.

Ses01M_impro05_M004 Are you insinuating that I don't have a college education and that- for some reason that makes you a better person than I am?
Ses01M_impro05_M005 Listen, shut your smug mouth, okay?  I don't need that.
Ses01M_impro05_M006 I've been sitting here for four hours.

Ses01M_impro05_M008 You work here.
Ses01M_impro05_M015 Okay.
Ses01M_impro05_M020 Probably people that work for your company huh?
Ses01M_impro05_M021 Do you know what was in that little bag that I could have just easily put in overhead compartment but no I had to check?
Ses01M_impro05_M022 My computer which has all of my data which I'm collecting right now.
Ses01M_impro05_M023 Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that.  So I need to have that back.
Ses01M_impro05_M024 Fifty dollars is not going to cover me for my job, okay?
Ses01M_impro05_M025 Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags?  Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.
Ses01M_impro05_M026 It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.
Ses01M_impro05_M027 Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.
Ses01M_impro05_M028 I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.
Ses01M_impro05_M031 Thank you very much.

Ses01M_impro06_M017 So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.

Ses01M_impro07_F000 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro07_F001 [LAUGHTER]. For softball? That's unbelievable. Is it slow pitch?
Ses01M_impro07_F003 Pinch hitting softball.

Ses01M_impro07_F013 Oh, you don't like that. You're west-sider?
Ses01M_impro07_F014 Okay. That would be way too much of a commute you can't do that. Especially- I know especially from--I don't know, what I was going to say, I don't know.
Ses01M_impro07_F015 I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.

Ses01M_impro07_F022 Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?
Ses01M_impro07_F023 That is unbelievable.

Ses01M_impro07_F026 No, no.  I love softball. I played softball all the time.
Ses01M_impro07_F027 I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.

Ses01M_impro07_M002 For softball.  They're going to pay me to go to school. Isn't that awesome?
Ses01M_impro07_M003 Yeah.  Well, I don't--well yeah I can pitch, I'm not like the pitcher though. I'm like the pinch hitter guy I mostly just hit.  But I guess I'm going to have to... Yeah, and then I play shortstop too but... It's so ex- The good news is I get to stay here.
Ses01M_impro07_M004 I know. For softball, yeah.
Ses01M_impro07_M005 Yeah, everything. Every like- free ride and I get to, you know, like be on like a Trojans sports team too. And it's like cool. Isn't it awesome?

Ses01M_impro07_M010 That's a really good idea. Or I could go to like Santa Monica. Go beach. Venice beach, yeah a little dirty though. I don't want to go to Venice beach. But - Malibu. All right.
Ses01M_impro07_M011 Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER]

Ses01M_script01_1_F017 Why?
Ses01M_script01_1_F020 Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.
Ses01M_script01_1_F023 I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_F024 From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_1_F025 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F026 Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses01M_script01_1_F029 I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses01M_script01_1_F030 That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.
Ses01M_script01_1_F031 He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.
Ses01M_script01_1_F032 Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.
Ses01M_script01_1_F035 Are you crazy?
Ses01M_script01_1_F036 You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?
Ses01M_script01_1_F037 Oh, must you be inspired.
Ses01M_script01_1_F039 Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F040 All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.
Ses01M_script01_1_F041 Well, you don't think like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_F042 I don't understand you, do I?
Ses01M_script01_1_F043 Well, I can see that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses01M_script01_1_M002 I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.
Ses01M_script01_1_M003 I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.
Ses01M_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.
Ses01M_script01_1_M005 Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.
Ses01M_script01_1_M006 I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_1_M007 I guess he is.
Ses01M_script01_1_M017 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01M_script01_1_M020 See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?
Ses01M_script01_1_M021 She is not Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_M023 To hell with that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M024 No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.
Ses01M_script01_1_M034 Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses01M_script01_1_M035 Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M037 Yes, on this I would.
Ses01M_script01_1_M038 Then help me stay here mom.
Ses01M_script01_1_M040 Then help me stay.
Ses01M_script01_1_M041 I am thinking like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M042 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses01M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses01M_script01_2_F001 It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses01M_script01_2_F004 What is going on here, Joe?
Ses01M_script01_2_F005 The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.
Ses01M_script01_2_F009 I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses01M_script01_2_F011 Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.
Ses01M_script01_2_F012 Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.
Ses01M_script01_2_F013 You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.
Ses01M_script01_2_M000 Well, maybe he wanted see her.
Ses01M_script01_2_M001 Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?
Ses01M_script01_2_M007 And how do you know why she's waited.
Ses01M_script01_2_M015 What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?
Ses01M_script01_2_M016 Look at you. You're shaking.
Ses01M_script01_2_M017 What the hell do you want from me, Kate?
Ses01M_script01_3_F000 The only one I know still love his parents.
Ses01M_script01_3_F001 Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.
Ses01M_script01_3_F003 Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.
Ses01M_script01_3_F004 For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.
Ses01M_script01_3_F005 [BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...
Ses01M_script01_3_F006 You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.
Ses01M_script01_3_F008 From her point of view why else would I come?
Ses01M_script01_3_F012 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses01M_script01_3_F014 Everyday since.
Ses01M_script01_3_F015 Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_F016 I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses01M_script01_3_F018 Chris, what's the matter?
Ses01M_script01_3_F019 No, what is it?  Is your mother?
Ses01M_script01_3_F021 You got to tell me.
Ses01M_script01_3_F022 Wouldn't work like this.
Ses01M_script01_3_F023 Yeah, sure.
Ses01M_script01_3_F024 How many?
Ses01M_script01_3_F025 [BREATHING]. Geez.
Ses01M_script01_3_F026 Do you still feel that way?
Ses01M_script01_3_F030 What would I do with a fortune?
Ses01M_script01_3_M000 Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?
Ses01M_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses01M_script01_3_M002 Why not?
Ses01M_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses01M_script01_3_M006 You did?
Ses01M_script01_3_M007 Yeah--
Ses01M_script01_3_M009 Ann, I love you.  I love you.
Ses01M_script01_3_M014 Why didn't you?
Ses01M_script01_3_M016 why didn't you let me know?
Ses01M_script01_3_M018 I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.
Ses01M_script01_3_M019 I kissed you.
Ses01M_script01_3_M020 Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.
Ses01M_script01_3_M021 No, no, it's nothing like that.
Ses01M_script01_3_M022 I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.
Ses01M_script01_3_M023 I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M024 It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.
Ses01M_script01_3_M025 you know over seas I was in command of the company?
Ses01M_script01_3_M026 Well I lost them.
Ses01M_script01_3_M027 Pretty much all.
Ses01M_script01_3_M028 Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M029 For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.
Ses01M_script01_3_M030 He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses01M_script01_3_M031 They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...
Ses01M_script01_3_M032 And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...
Ses01M_script01_3_M033 You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M034 I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...
Ses01M_script01_3_M035 You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...
Ses01M_script01_3_M036 And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.
Ses01M_script01_3_M037 Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.
Ses01M_script01_3_M038 'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...
Ses01M_script01_3_M039 And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.
Ses01M_script01_3_M040 I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.
Ses01M_script01_3_M041 I want you to know Annie.
Ses01M_script01_3_M043 I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses01M_script02_1_F005 You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?
Ses01M_script02_1_F007 No.
Ses01M_script02_1_F008 I'm fine.
Ses01M_script02_1_F009 I wonder if they can hear me talk
Ses01M_script02_1_F014 Then let's go.
Ses01M_script02_1_F017 Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.
Ses01M_script02_1_F021 Yes.
Ses01M_script02_1_F022 Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.
Ses01M_script02_1_F023 We didn't see them the year before either.
Ses01M_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.
Ses01M_script02_1_M001 Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good.
Ses01M_script02_1_M002 Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--
Ses01M_script02_1_M004 Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?
Ses01M_script02_1_M005 Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?
Ses01M_script02_1_M007 Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?
Ses01M_script02_1_M009 Oh, well, yeah of course.
Ses01M_script02_1_M010 Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.
Ses01M_script02_1_M011 Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.
Ses01M_script02_1_M014 You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.
Ses01M_script02_1_M016 Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.
Ses01M_script02_1_M017 I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.
Ses01M_script02_1_M022 Right.
Ses01M_script02_1_M023 That's my point too.
Ses01M_script02_1_M028 People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.
Ses01M_script02_1_M030 Yeah, they do.
Ses01M_script02_1_M031 Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.
Ses01M_script02_1_M032 It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.
Ses01M_script02_1_M037 We just weren't in a good spot though.
Ses01M_script02_1_M039 Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...
Ses01M_script02_1_M040 Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...
Ses01M_script02_1_M041 They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...
Ses01M_script02_1_M042 They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...
Ses01M_script02_1_M043 Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...
Ses01M_script02_1_M044 And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...
Ses01M_script02_1_M045 It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.
Ses01M_script02_1_M046 It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.
Ses01M_script02_2_F000 That's the wind.
Ses01M_script02_2_F010 Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.
Ses01M_script02_2_F011 I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses01M_script02_2_F013 Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?
Ses01M_script02_2_F014 Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.
Ses01M_script02_2_F015 No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.
Ses01M_script02_2_F016 I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.
Ses01M_script02_2_F019 Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.
Ses01M_script02_2_F022 And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses01M_script02_2_F024 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses01M_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses01M_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses01M_script02_2_F030 I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
Ses01M_script02_2_F031 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses01M_script02_2_F032 Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.
Ses01M_script02_2_F033 This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.
Ses01M_script02_2_F034 This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?
Ses01M_script02_2_F035 I know that Augie, I really do.
Ses01M_script02_2_F036 I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.
Ses01M_script02_2_F037 I didn't say that.
Ses01M_script02_2_F040 You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.
Ses01M_script02_2_F044 I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses01M_script02_2_F045 I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.
Ses01M_script02_2_F046 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses01M_script02_2_F047 Or not.
Ses01M_script02_2_M001 ...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...
Ses01M_script02_2_M002 Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.
Ses01M_script02_2_M003 Well, so?  What do you think?
Ses01M_script02_2_M008 Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?
Ses01M_script02_2_M013 We missed them twice.
Ses01M_script02_2_M019 you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.
Ses01M_script02_2_M020 Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go."
Ses01M_script02_2_M021 So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--
Ses01M_script02_2_M022 Wait a minute, I've got it.
Ses01M_script02_2_M023 It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?
Ses01M_script02_2_M025 Oh right sure, of course.
Ses01M_script02_2_M027 You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses01M_script02_2_M028 Do you want to take off our shoes?
Ses01M_script02_2_M029 What? Huh?
Ses01M_script02_2_M030 You want to get married again?
Ses01M_script02_2_M033 A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?
Ses01M_script02_2_M035 You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M037 No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--
Ses01M_script02_2_M038 No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.
Ses01M_script02_2_M039 Yeah, it is.
Ses01M_script02_2_M040 Right.
Ses01M_script02_2_M041 I know me neither.
Ses01M_script02_2_M042 I'm doing the best I can.
Ses01M_script02_2_M043 Maybe if you were with somebody else too?
Ses01M_script02_2_M044 No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.
Ses01M_script02_2_M045 Yeah?
Ses01M_script02_2_M049 Look what we got here.
Ses01M_script02_2_M050 It's not champagne.
Ses01M_script02_2_M051 Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?
Ses01M_script02_2_M052 Shh...
Ses01M_script02_2_M053 If we are really quiet, the fish might come.
Ses01M_script02_2_M054 Or not.
Ses01M_script03_1_F003 Now and always sweet.
Ses01M_script03_1_F004 It had to happen sooner or later.
Ses01M_script03_1_F007 [BREATHING]
Ses01M_script03_1_F008 Oh. Behave exquisitely...
Ses01M_script03_1_F009 [LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.
Ses01M_script03_1_F010 [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_F011 Mmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_F014 Oh, yes meaning just that.
Ses01M_script03_1_F015 [LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.
Ses01M_script03_1_F017 Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.
Ses01M_script03_1_F018 How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?
Ses01M_script03_1_F019 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses01M_script03_1_F021 If one of us dies...
Ses01M_script03_1_F024 I think you're talking nonsense.
Ses01M_script03_1_F030 Which particular one?
Ses01M_script03_1_F031 Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses01M_script03_1_F034 Cannes...mmhmm...
Ses01M_script03_1_F036 The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_F037 Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...
Ses01M_script03_1_F038 Utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses01M_script03_1_F039 oh...[LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_F040 Very much sillier.
Ses01M_script03_1_F041 Oh you knew there was nothing in that.
Ses01M_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses01M_script03_1_M010 With perfect poise...
Ses01M_script03_1_M011 Ah...
Ses01M_script03_1_M012 Ah...Strange...
Ses01M_script03_1_M013 Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?
Ses01M_script03_1_M014 Darling, don't say that.
Ses01M_script03_1_M016 Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?
Ses01M_script03_1_M017 You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want.
Ses01M_script03_1_M019 Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.
Ses01M_script03_1_M021 We are figures of fun all right
Ses01M_script03_1_M022 Ahh...who knows.
Ses01M_script03_1_M028 Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_M029 Come here darling, kiss me
Ses01M_script03_1_M030 before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
Ses01M_script03_1_M031 See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome.
Ses01M_script03_1_M033 Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?
Ses01M_script03_1_M037 But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.
Ses01M_script03_1_M039 I will never forget the look on his face.
Ses01M_script03_1_M040 oh...
Ses01M_script03_1_M041 We were very much younger then.
Ses01M_script03_2_F006 Well, what of it?
Ses01M_script03_2_F010 No, thank you.
Ses01M_script03_2_F011 I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.
Ses01M_script03_2_F015 Don't be stupid, what?
Ses01M_script03_2_F017 Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?
Ses01M_script03_2_F022 They sting.
Ses01M_script03_2_F023 I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
Ses01M_script03_2_F024 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses01M_script03_2_F025 Oh, mind you own business.
Ses01M_script03_2_F026 You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses01M_script03_2_F027 You always had a weak head.
Ses01M_script03_2_F028 On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses01M_script03_2_F029 Shut up.
Ses01M_script03_2_F030 Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?
Ses01M_script03_2_F031 Why?
Ses01M_script03_2_F033 They are away in Tunis.
Ses01M_script03_2_F034 Turn it on again, please.
Ses01M_script03_2_F035 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses01M_script03_2_F036 I won't.
Ses01M_script03_2_F037 Stop it. No. Go away.
Ses01M_script03_2_F038 listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.
Ses01M_script03_2_F039 Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible.
Ses01M_script03_2_F040 This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
Ses01M_script03_2_F041 Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.
Ses01M_script03_2_M012 I'll have a little, I think.
Ses01M_script03_2_M013 Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.
Ses01M_script03_2_M018 Are you going out somewhere dear?
Ses01M_script03_2_M022 You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.
Ses01M_script03_2_M023 You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.
Ses01M_script03_2_M024 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
Ses01M_script03_2_M025 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses01M_script03_2_M026 I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.
Ses01M_script03_2_M027 I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.
Ses01M_script03_2_M028 I am not in the least bit drunk.
Ses01M_script03_2_M029 I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.
Ses01M_script03_2_M030 Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.
Ses01M_script03_2_M031 That's a very good idea I think I will.
Ses01M_script03_2_M032 Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.
Ses01M_script03_2_M033 Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.
Ses01M_script03_2_M034 This is no time a year for Tunis.
Ses01M_script03_2_M035 I will do no such thing.
Ses01M_script03_2_M036 Turn it off. It's driving me mad.
Ses01M_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.
Ses01M_script03_2_M038 Amanda listen. Listen.
Ses01M_script03_2_M039 That's very amusing indeed.
Ses01M_script03_2_M040 You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.
Ses01M_script03_2_M041 You're not going like this.
Ses01M_script03_2_M042 No you're not.
Ses01M_script03_2_M043 Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses02F_impro01_F000 Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration.
Ses02F_impro01_F018 Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?
Ses02F_impro01_F019 Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.

Ses02F_impro01_F021 Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.

Ses02F_impro03_M025 Oh, yes.  This is the whole [GARBAGE]
Ses02F_impro03_M026 It'll be good.  Wow, that's great.
Ses02F_impro04_F009 I feel so worthless.
Ses02F_impro04_F016 I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.
Ses02F_impro04_M000 So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?
Ses02F_impro04_M001 No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't
Ses02F_impro04_M003 No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]
Ses02F_impro04_M004 I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--
Ses02F_impro04_M005 No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.
Ses02F_impro04_M006 There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...
Ses02F_impro04_M007 ...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know
Ses02F_impro04_M008 I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--
Ses02F_impro04_M009 But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?
Ses02F_impro04_M010 It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and...
Ses02F_impro04_M011 ... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--
Ses02F_impro04_M012 Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-
Ses02F_impro04_M013 Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know
Ses02F_impro04_M015 That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--
Ses02F_impro04_M016 Right.
Ses02F_impro04_M017 Well, you've gotta live.
Ses02F_impro04_M018 I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--
Ses02F_impro04_M019 Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though.
Ses02F_impro05_F000 Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage.
Ses02F_impro05_F001 No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?
Ses02F_impro05_F004 How much?
Ses02F_impro05_F006 That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?
Ses02F_impro05_F010 Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.
Ses02F_impro05_F019 It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.
Ses02F_impro05_M000 Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--
Ses02F_impro05_M001 Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the--
Ses02F_impro05_M002 Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-
Ses02F_impro05_M003 You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen.
Ses02F_impro05_M004 Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--
Ses02F_impro05_M005 Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--
Ses02F_impro05_M006 Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do.
Ses02F_impro05_M007 I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--
Ses02F_impro05_M008 Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--
Ses02F_impro05_M009 Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um
Ses02F_impro05_M010 By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--
Ses02F_impro05_M011 Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--
Ses02F_impro05_M012 You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?
Ses02F_impro05_M013 Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--
Ses02F_impro05_M014 No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you
Ses02F_impro05_M015 probably even talk to--
Ses02F_impro05_M016 Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh
Ses02F_impro05_M017 but Unfortunately sometimes is--
Ses02F_impro05_M018 Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--
Ses02F_impro05_M019 Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.
Ses02F_impro05_M020 All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.
Ses02F_impro05_M021 Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.
Ses02F_impro06_F000 Um, Johnny died yesterday.
Ses02F_impro06_F001 We knew that it was coming, but--
Ses02F_impro06_F002 It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well.
Ses02F_impro06_F003 Yeah.
Ses02F_impro06_F004 I just don't want him to be gone.
Ses02F_impro06_F005 And his whole family was there.
Ses02F_impro06_F006 I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know
Ses02F_impro06_F007 He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about...
Ses02F_impro06_F008 ...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--
Ses02F_impro06_F009 Nobody's ever gonna forget him.
Ses02F_impro06_F010 He did a lot.  But--
Ses02F_impro06_F011 I'm gonna forget him.
Ses02F_impro06_F012 I won't be able to hear his voice or his--
Ses02F_impro06_F013 You start to lose like that image after a while.
Ses02F_impro06_F014 Thanks.
Ses02F_impro06_M000 Hey, a what's up?
Ses02F_impro06_M001 Wow, that's horrible.
Ses02F_impro06_M002 I'm sorry to hear about that.
Ses02F_impro06_M003 Yeah.
Ses02F_impro06_M004 I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right?
Ses02F_impro06_M005 It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that.
Ses02F_impro06_M006 It's okay.
Ses02F_impro06_M007 'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on.
Ses02F_impro06_M008 I mean--I don't know.
Ses02F_impro06_M009 Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than...
Ses02F_impro06_M010 .than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean--
Ses02F_impro06_M011 But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and--
Ses02F_impro06_M012 Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and
Ses02F_impro06_M013 And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean--
Ses02F_impro06_M014 I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but--
Ses02F_impro06_M015 But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--
Ses02F_impro06_M016 No, you'll never forget him.
Ses02F_impro06_M017 I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--
Ses02F_impro06_M018 That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so .
Ses02F_impro06_M019 It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now.
Ses02F_impro07_F001 I got into U.S.C.
Ses02F_impro07_F002 Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say--
Ses02F_impro07_F003 Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway.
Ses02F_impro07_F004 So--
Ses02F_impro07_F005 Yeah, I know.
Ses02F_impro07_F006 Absolutely. I'm so excited.
Ses02F_impro07_F007 I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like...
Ses02F_impro07_F008 ...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school
Ses02F_impro07_F009 and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like...
Ses02F_impro07_F010 You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C.
Ses02F_impro07_F011 And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you...
Ses02F_impro07_F012 ...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean?
Ses02F_impro07_F013 Like it has some prestige. so
Ses02F_impro07_F014 Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine--
Ses02F_impro07_F015 Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind.
Ses02F_impro07_F016 I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know--
Ses02F_impro07_F017 Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know
Ses02F_impro07_F018 I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited.
Ses02F_impro07_F019 Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate.
Ses02F_impro07_F020 You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want.
Ses02F_impro07_F021 Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first...
Ses02F_impro07_F022 ...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean?
Ses02F_impro07_F023 So, um, so I don't know.

Ses02F_impro08_F000 Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you?
Ses02F_impro08_F001 All right, sir.
Ses02F_impro08_F002 I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.
Ses02F_impro08_F003 Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?
Ses02F_impro08_F004 Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.
Ses02F_impro08_F005 I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,
Ses02F_impro08_F006 um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.
Ses02F_impro08_F007 Is that all right?
Ses02F_impro08_F008 I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.
Ses02F_impro08_F009 All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-
Ses02F_impro08_F010 um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.
Ses02F_impro08_F011 Absolutely. we we
Ses02F_impro08_F012 Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.
Ses02F_impro08_F013 So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.
Ses02F_impro08_F014 Yeah.
Ses02F_impro08_F015 Okay.
Ses02F_impro08_F016 Great.  How many seats?
Ses02F_impro08_F017 Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.
Ses02F_impro08_F018 Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?
Ses02F_impro08_F019 Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?
Ses02F_impro08_F020 Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?
Ses02F_impro08_F021 All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.
Ses02F_impro08_F022 So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.
Ses02F_impro08_F023 Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.
Ses02F_impro08_F024 And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.
Ses02F_impro08_F025 Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.
Ses02F_impro08_F026 Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.
Ses02F_impro08_F027 Thank you.
Ses02F_impro08_M003 Okay.
Ses02F_impro08_M005 You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.
Ses02F_impro08_M006 [BREATHING] that's good.
Ses02F_impro08_M007 All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.
Ses02F_impro08_M008 Okay. So--
Ses02F_impro08_M009 Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a
Ses02F_impro08_M010 --you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um
Ses02F_impro08_M011 Well, it's gonna be four of them.
Ses02F_impro08_M012 All right.  And can they like all get together?
Ses02F_impro08_M013 Um- You know, window is nice. I guess
Ses02F_impro08_M015 Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--
Ses02F_impro08_M016 And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.
Ses02F_impro08_M018 All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.
Ses02F_impro08_M019 Okay.
Ses02F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses02F_script01_1_F005 He cried hard?
Ses02F_script01_1_F006 What was he doing out here at that hour?
Ses02F_script01_1_F017 I've got an idea, but what's the story?
Ses02F_script01_1_F018 Well, that's only your business, Chris.
Ses02F_script01_1_F019 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses02F_script01_1_F021 I'm just saying that--
Ses02F_script01_1_F025 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_F026 [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses02F_script01_1_F027 Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses02F_script01_1_F028 Trouble is, you don't see enough women.
Ses02F_script01_1_F036 Are you crazy?
Ses02F_script01_1_F037 What about the business?  What the hell is this?
Ses02F_script01_1_F038 Must you be inspired?
Ses02F_script01_1_F040 Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses02F_script01_1_F044 I can see that.
Ses02F_script01_1_M011 Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?
Ses02F_script01_1_M013 For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses02F_script01_1_M017 I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Ses02F_script01_1_M021 Well, then it isn't just my business--
Ses02F_script01_1_M023 She's not Larry's girl.
Ses02F_script01_1_M025 To hell with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_M027 Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses02F_script01_1_M029 Because it is.
Ses02F_script01_1_M036 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses02F_script01_1_M037 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02F_script01_1_M038 Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
Ses02F_script01_1_M040 Yes, on this I would.
Ses02F_script01_1_M043 I am thinkin' that way.
Ses02F_script01_1_M044 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses02F_script01_2_F005 It's got that all about it.
Ses02F_script01_2_F012 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...
Ses02F_script01_2_F013 But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.
Ses02F_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses02F_script01_2_M002 What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?
Ses02F_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02F_script01_2_M005 Well, so what?
Ses02F_script01_2_M006 Now, listen Kate.
Ses02F_script01_2_M007 You can't read her mind.
Ses02F_script01_2_M008 How do you know why she's waited?
Ses02F_script01_2_M016 What does that mean?  Me above all?
Ses02F_script01_2_M017 Look at you.  Look at you shaking.
Ses02F_script01_2_M018 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?
Ses02F_script01_3_F009 from her point of view, why else would I come?
Ses02F_script01_3_F012 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses02F_script01_3_F013 You started to write me and--
Ses02F_script01_3_F014 Every day since.
Ses02F_script01_3_F016 I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses02F_script01_3_F020 Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.
Ses02F_script01_3_F021 You've gotta tell me.
Ses02F_script01_3_F022 It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02F_script01_3_F023 Yeah, sure.
Ses02F_script01_3_F024 How many?
Ses02F_script01_3_F025 Oh, gee.
Ses02F_script01_3_F026 You still feel that way?
Ses02F_script01_3_F029 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02F_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses02F_script01_3_M010 You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.
Ses02F_script01_3_M020 No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02F_script01_3_M021 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses02F_script01_3_M022 I don't know how to start.
Ses02F_script01_3_M023 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
Ses02F_script01_3_M024 Well, I lost them.
Ses02F_script01_3_M025 Just about all.
Ses02F_script01_3_M026 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02F_script01_3_M027 For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses02F_script01_3_M028 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses02F_script01_3_M029 I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.
Ses02F_script01_3_M030 You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
Ses02F_script01_3_M031 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
Ses02F_script01_3_M032 And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
Ses02F_script01_3_M033 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
Ses02F_script01_3_M034 Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02F_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses02F_script02_1_F005 Yeah.
Ses02F_script02_1_F019 We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses02F_script02_1_F021 About what?
Ses02F_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02F_script02_1_M001 This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.
Ses02F_script02_1_M002 I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.
Ses02F_script02_1_M003 How you doing?
Ses02F_script02_1_M004 Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.
Ses02F_script02_1_M005 Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?
Ses02F_script02_1_M006 How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.
Ses02F_script02_1_M009 Oh, well sure.
Ses02F_script02_1_M010 Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.
Ses02F_script02_1_M012 I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?
Ses02F_script02_1_M013 You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.
Ses02F_script02_1_M014 This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.
Ses02F_script02_1_M015 I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
Ses02F_script02_1_M016 You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02F_script02_1_M017 Do you want my jacket?
Ses02F_script02_1_M019 Right.
Ses02F_script02_1_M020 That's my point too.
Ses02F_script02_1_M021 No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
Ses02F_script02_1_M024 Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses02F_script02_1_M025 Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,
Ses02F_script02_1_M026 this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
Ses02F_script02_1_M028 Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.
Ses02F_script02_1_M031 I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.
Ses02F_script02_1_M033 We weren't in a good spot.
Ses02F_script02_1_M035 There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?
Ses02F_script02_1_M036 Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.
Ses02F_script02_1_M039 all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.
Ses02F_script02_1_M040 It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.
Ses02F_script02_1_M041 They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses02F_script02_1_M042 Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.
Ses02F_script02_1_M043 Well, so what do you think?
Ses02F_script02_1_M044 What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses02F_script02_2_F005 God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses02F_script02_2_F006 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02F_script02_2_F011 I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.
Ses02F_script02_2_F015 Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.
Ses02F_script02_2_F016 I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses02F_script02_2_F017 And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses02F_script02_2_F018 And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
Ses02F_script02_2_F019 Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses02F_script02_2_F020 I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses02F_script02_2_F021 No.
Ses02F_script02_2_F022 No.
Ses02F_script02_2_F024 No.
Ses02F_script02_2_F031 Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses02F_script02_2_F033 I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.
Ses02F_script02_2_F034 I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses02F_script02_2_F035 I didn't say that.
Ses02F_script02_2_F038 You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses02F_script02_2_F041 Augie, you brought refreshments.
Ses02F_script02_2_F042 Well, then we don't need glasses.
Ses02F_script02_2_F043 No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses02F_script02_2_F044 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses02F_script02_2_F045 Or not.
Ses02F_script02_2_M000 Well, so what do you think?
Ses02F_script02_2_M001 What I was saying.
Ses02F_script02_2_M002 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02F_script02_2_M003 Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.
Ses02F_script02_2_M005 Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
Ses02F_script02_2_M007 There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.
Ses02F_script02_2_M009 We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.
Ses02F_script02_2_M010 Well, we'll see them this year.
Ses02F_script02_2_M013 It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.
Ses02F_script02_2_M016 You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."
Ses02F_script02_2_M017 Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--
Ses02F_script02_2_M018 Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses02F_script02_2_M019 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right?
Ses02F_script02_2_M020 Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?
Ses02F_script02_2_M021 Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?
Ses02F_script02_2_M022 You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses02F_script02_2_M023 Take off our shoes?
Ses02F_script02_2_M029 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?
Ses02F_script02_2_M031 No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us
Ses02F_script02_2_M033 Yes, it is.
Ses02F_script02_2_M034 Right.
Ses02F_script02_2_M035 I know, me neither.
Ses02F_script02_2_M036 I'm doing the best I can.
Ses02F_script02_2_M037 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses02F_script02_2_M038 No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses02F_script02_2_M041 I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.
Ses02F_script02_2_M042 Well, look what we have here.
Ses02F_script02_2_M043 It's not champagne.
Ses02F_script02_2_M045 Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses02F_script02_2_M046 Or not.
Ses02F_script03_1_F005 Ah, it send shivers up my spine.
Ses02F_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses02F_script03_1_F007 Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.
Ses02F_script03_1_F008 What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses02F_script03_1_F009 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses02F_script03_1_F010 Yes, meaning just that.
Ses02F_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses02F_script03_1_F013 If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.
Ses02F_script03_1_F014 Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.
Ses02F_script03_1_F015 Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses02F_script03_1_F016 Oh, dear, shall we like that?
Ses02F_script03_1_F017 Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses02F_script03_1_F019 Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.
Ses02F_script03_1_F020 Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses02F_script03_1_F021 Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
Ses02F_script03_1_F022 Which particular one?
Ses02F_script03_1_F023 Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses02F_script03_1_F024 Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses02F_script03_1_F025 It went in intermittently for days.
Ses02F_script03_1_F026 It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02F_script03_1_F027 That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses02F_script03_1_F028 The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses02F_script03_1_F029 It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.
Ses02F_script03_1_M001 I wonder.
Ses02F_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses02F_script03_1_M005 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses02F_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise?
Ses02F_script03_1_M008 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
Ses02F_script03_1_M009 Oh, darling, don't say that.
Ses02F_script03_1_M010 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
Ses02F_script03_1_M012 You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.
Ses02F_script03_1_M013 All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.
Ses02F_script03_1_M014 Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses02F_script03_1_M015 Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.
Ses02F_script03_1_M016 Who knows.
Ses02F_script03_1_M017 No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.
Ses02F_script03_1_M018 Depends on how well we've played.
Ses02F_script03_1_M019 Yes.  Yes. With all his might.
Ses02F_script03_1_M020 No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.
Ses02F_script03_1_M021 So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02F_script03_1_M022 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses02F_script03_1_M023 Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses02F_script03_1_M024 I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.
Ses02F_script03_1_M025 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02F_script03_1_M026 The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.
Ses02F_script03_1_M028 How long did that row last?
Ses02F_script03_1_M029 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses02F_script03_1_M031 I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses02F_script03_1_M032 Oh, I'll never forget his face.
Ses02F_script03_1_M033 We were very much younger then.
Ses02F_script03_1_M034 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02F_script03_2_F007 Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.
Ses02F_script03_2_F011 Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_F012 Well, it's become a habit with you.
Ses02F_script03_2_F013 Don't be so stupid.
Ses02F_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses02F_script03_2_F016 A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?
Ses02F_script03_2_F018 Oh, be quiet.
Ses02F_script03_2_F020 Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses02F_script03_2_F025 You're quite insufferable
Ses02F_script03_2_F029 Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_F031 Why?
Ses02F_script03_2_F034 Turn it on again, please.
Ses02F_script03_2_F035 Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses02F_script03_2_F036 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses02F_script03_2_F037 Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses02F_script03_2_F038 Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.
Ses02F_script03_2_F039 I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses02F_script03_2_F040 This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.
Ses02F_script03_2_F041 Oh Yes, I am.
Ses02F_script03_2_F042 I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.
Ses02F_script03_2_F043 Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.
Ses02F_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02F_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses02F_script03_2_M006 What of it?
Ses02F_script03_2_M007 Well, what about me?
Ses02F_script03_2_M009 Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?
Ses02F_script03_2_M011 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses02F_script03_2_M013 You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
Ses02F_script03_2_M027 I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses02F_script03_2_M030 We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.
Ses02F_script03_2_M036 I'll do no such thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses02F_script03_2_M038 Turn it off.
Ses02F_script03_2_M039 Amanda, listen. listen
Ses02F_script03_2_M041 You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02F_script03_2_M042 You're not going like this.
Ses02F_script03_2_M043 You're not.
Ses02F_script03_2_M044 Shut up. Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_M045 I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--
Ses02F_script03_2_M046 I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees
Ses02F_script03_2_M047 You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_impro01_F000 Hi, How can I help you?
Ses02M_impro01_F001 Sure, um
Ses02M_impro01_F002 do you have two forms of ID with you?
Ses02M_impro01_F003 I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro01_F004 Well
Ses02M_impro01_F005 I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.
Ses02M_impro01_F006 Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.
Ses02M_impro01_F015 I'm sorry, sir.
Ses02M_impro01_F016 there is nothing I can do.
Ses02M_impro01_M001 Yea. I just want to get this done,
Ses02M_impro01_M002 get my new license.
Ses02M_impro01_M003 Um, no, I got my driver's license though.
Ses02M_impro01_M004 Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -
Ses02M_impro01_M005 well is the dri-driver's license going to work?
Ses02M_impro01_M007 What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after
Ses02M_impro01_M008 three hours and
Ses02M_impro01_M009 Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?
Ses02M_impro01_M010 It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my
Ses02M_impro01_M011 I filled out the application right, didn't I?
Ses02M_impro01_M018 You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application
Ses02M_impro01_M019 What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.
Ses02M_impro02_F000 I don't want you to go.
Ses02M_impro02_F001 I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.
Ses02M_impro02_F002 I don't want to be a single mom.
Ses02M_impro02_F003 but
Ses02M_impro02_F004 It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll
Ses02M_impro02_F005 I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_F006 I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_F007 It's going to be really rough.
Ses02M_impro02_F008 I'll send you lots of pictures.
Ses02M_impro02_F009 Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.
Ses02M_impro02_F010 I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get
Ses02M_impro02_F012 Will you write me letters, paper ones?
Ses02M_impro02_F013 Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.
Ses02M_impro02_F014 I'll miss you too.
Ses02M_impro02_M000 I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.
Ses02M_impro02_M001 You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and
Ses02M_impro02_M002 and
Ses02M_impro02_M007 You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?
Ses02M_impro02_M008 I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Ses02M_impro02_M009 I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.
Ses02M_impro02_M013 there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country
Ses02M_impro02_M014 and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back
Ses02M_impro02_M017 Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.
Ses02M_impro02_M018 I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.
Ses02M_impro03_F000 What? What? You look really happy what's going on?
Ses02M_impro03_F001 Finally did what?
Ses02M_impro03_F003 Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did
Ses02M_impro03_F004 Did she say yes?
Ses02M_impro03_F005 That's like the most definitive.
Ses02M_impro03_F007 I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.
Ses02M_impro03_F008 Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?
Ses02M_impro03_F011 Oh, You did not.
Ses02M_impro03_F012 Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute
Ses02M_impro03_F013 That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God.
Ses02M_impro03_F014 She must have flipped out.
Ses02M_impro03_F015 Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_F016 Did you bring her up on stage too?
Ses02M_impro03_F017 Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.
Ses02M_impro03_F018 Are your parents excited or...?
Ses02M_impro03_F020 Ooh, that would be fun.
Ses02M_impro03_F023 Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.
Ses02M_impro03_F024 Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_F028 Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.
Ses02M_impro03_M000 Oh, you're never going to believe it.
Ses02M_impro03_M001 Well, I finally did it
Ses02M_impro03_M005 Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know
Ses02M_impro03_M008 Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know
Ses02M_impro03_M009 I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now.
Ses02M_impro03_M010 Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah
Ses02M_impro03_M011 so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-
Ses02M_impro03_M012 I-I did.
Ses02M_impro03_M014 I know, so
Ses02M_impro03_M015 I got to freak her out.
Ses02M_impro03_M016 No, yes -- so
Ses02M_impro03_M017 Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.
Ses02M_impro03_M018 No, but it was good.
Ses02M_impro03_M019 Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_M020 I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.
Ses02M_impro03_M021 Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...
Ses02M_impro03_M024 Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first
Ses02M_impro03_M026 I know.
Ses02M_impro03_M027 Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.
Ses02M_impro03_M028 Sure. Oh, yes.
Ses02M_impro03_M030 Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah
Ses02M_impro03_M031 Hah.
Ses02M_impro04_F000 So how you feeling?
Ses02M_impro04_F001 You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?
Ses02M_impro04_F002 Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -
Ses02M_impro04_F003 you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.
Ses02M_impro04_F004 Well, but you care about what you do, right?
Ses02M_impro04_F005 I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh
Ses02M_impro04_F006 Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.
Ses02M_impro04_F007 You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's
Ses02M_impro04_F008 Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.
Ses02M_impro04_F009 I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro04_F010 That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like
Ses02M_impro04_F011 and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.
Ses02M_impro04_F012 So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.
Ses02M_impro04_F014 You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.
Ses02M_impro04_F015 But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.
Ses02M_impro04_F016 Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.
Ses02M_impro04_M014 I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking
Ses02M_impro04_M019 this doesn't happen to a normal person.
Ses02M_impro04_M022 Right. Thanks for talking to me.
Ses02M_impro05_F000 Hi, can I help you?
Ses02M_impro05_F001 Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-
Ses02M_impro05_F002 Okay. Well, um- the f.
Ses02M_impro05_F003 Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-
Ses02M_impro05_F004 Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-
Ses02M_impro05_F005 Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that
Ses02M_impro05_F006 Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.
Ses02M_impro05_F007 Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.
Ses02M_impro05_F008 I- I- I understand, but um.
Ses02M_impro05_F009 Okay
Ses02M_impro05_F010 Right.
Ses02M_impro05_F011 I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-
Ses02M_impro05_F012 Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and
Ses02M_impro05_F013 they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.
Ses02M_impro05_F014 So we'll- what we'll do
Ses02M_impro05_F015 Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.
Ses02M_impro05_F016 Um, so.
Ses02M_impro05_F017 We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know
Ses02M_impro05_F018 I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.
Ses02M_impro05_F019 I understand, so-
Ses02M_impro05_F020 all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage
Ses02M_impro05_F021 and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-
Ses02M_impro05_F023 Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-
Ses02M_impro05_F024 The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-
Ses02M_impro05_F025 Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have
Ses02M_impro05_F026 we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-
Ses02M_impro05_M000 Hi. Um-
Ses02M_impro05_M001 It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.
Ses02M_impro05_M002 Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.
Ses02M_impro05_M003 Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know
Ses02M_impro05_M013 But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and
Ses02M_impro05_M016 Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-
Ses02M_impro05_M018 you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay
Ses02M_impro05_M025 The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-
Ses02M_impro05_M026 I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do
Ses02M_impro06_F002 It doesn't make any easier, yes.
Ses02M_impro06_F003 Oh, man. I'm so sorry.
Ses02M_impro06_F004 It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro06_F005 Yeah.
Ses02M_impro06_F006 Totally.
Ses02M_impro06_F007 Yeah
Ses02M_impro06_F008 Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.
Ses02M_impro06_F009 She really cared about you, you know.
Ses02M_impro06_F010 And she was
Ses02M_impro06_F011 Yeah.
Ses02M_impro06_F012 Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.
Ses02M_impro06_F013 Are you going to be okay?
Ses02M_impro06_F014 It's going to be okay, I promise.
Ses02M_impro06_F015 Sure
Ses02M_impro06_F016 you shouldn't be alone
Ses02M_impro06_F017 Yes.
Ses02M_impro06_F018 Yes.
Ses02M_impro06_M000 Kathy died last night.
Ses02M_impro06_M001 yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -
Ses02M_impro06_M002 I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.
Ses02M_impro06_M003 I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,
Ses02M_impro06_M004 She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it.
Ses02M_impro06_M005 Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but
Ses02M_impro06_M006 God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go
Ses02M_impro06_M007 out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean.
Ses02M_impro06_M008 It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know
Ses02M_impro06_M009 not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.
Ses02M_impro06_M010 She was [garbage]
Ses02M_impro06_M011 Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great
Ses02M_impro06_M012 so loving everybody you know.
Ses02M_impro06_M013 Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.
Ses02M_impro06_M014 We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.
Ses02M_impro06_M015 Yes.  [BREATHING] God.
Ses02M_impro06_M016 I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it
Ses02M_impro06_M017 just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.
Ses02M_impro06_M018 Then she's gone.
Ses02M_impro06_M019 Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps
Ses02M_impro06_M020 to talk to somebody but
Ses02M_impro06_M021 It's just going to take a while, I think.

Ses02M_impro08_F000 Hi. Thank you so much, you're a real person, right, you're not like a recording?
Ses02M_impro08_F001 Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-
Ses02M_impro08_F002 it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there.
Ses02M_impro08_F006 Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes
Ses02M_impro08_F007 Thank you very much. Um  So I have a charge on my credit card that, um, isn't mine.
Ses02M_impro08_F008 Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so
Ses02M_impro08_F010 Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something
Ses02M_impro08_F019 I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-
Ses02M_impro08_F023 Great.
Ses02M_impro08_F024 Yeah.
Ses02M_impro08_F025 Right, right.
Ses02M_impro08_F026 Okay, great.
Ses02M_impro08_F027 Yeah, totally.
Ses02M_impro08_F028 Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.
Ses02M_impro08_F030 Thank you very much bye.
Ses02M_impro08_M000 All right. Customer service this is Steve.
Ses02M_impro08_M002 Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.
Ses02M_impro08_M003 I- I'll give you a little hint, next time if it asks if you're on a rotary phone you know, just stay on the line instead of - instead of hitting one or two to say if you're like on a touch tone
Ses02M_impro08_M004 pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.
Ses02M_impro08_M005 I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.
Ses02M_impro08_M007 Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think
Ses02M_impro08_M008 Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here.
Ses02M_impro08_M009 All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's
Ses02M_impro08_M010 it- it'll work out fine.
Ses02M_impro08_M011 Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay.
Ses02M_impro08_M012 So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website.
Ses02M_impro08_M013 Yeah. Yeah. You get the form right now. and- yeah
Ses02M_impro08_M014 We could mail it to you as well, but-
Ses02M_impro08_M015 Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-
Ses02M_impro08_M016 and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know
Ses02M_impro08_M017 Right. I mean we might
Ses02M_impro08_M018 Okay.
Ses02M_impro08_M019 Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-
Ses02M_impro08_M020 Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so
Ses02M_impro08_M021 so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.
Ses02M_impro08_M022 Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-
Ses02M_impro08_M023 it's a different number and everything
Ses02M_impro08_M024 Yeah. yeah.
Ses02M_impro08_M025 Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?
Ses02M_impro08_M026 Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And
Ses02M_impro08_M027 And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um
Ses02M_impro08_M028 if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and
Ses02M_impro08_M029 and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-
Ses02M_impro08_M030 you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.
Ses02M_impro08_M031 Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of.
Ses02M_script01_1_F015 I got an idea but what's the story?
Ses02M_script01_1_F018 Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-
Ses02M_script01_1_F021 From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.
Ses02M_script01_1_F023 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_F025 How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses02M_script01_1_F026 Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.
Ses02M_script01_1_F027 I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses02M_script01_1_F032 What the hell is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_F033 What the hell is this, are you crazy?
Ses02M_script01_1_F034 What about the business? What is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_F035 Must you be inspired?
Ses02M_script01_1_F036 Tell me, you'd leave the business?
Ses02M_script01_1_F037 Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses02M_script01_1_F041 Yea, I can see that.
Ses02M_script01_1_M003 I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
Ses02M_script01_1_M004 No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses02M_script01_1_M005 I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
Ses02M_script01_1_M012 We've got to say it to him.
Ses02M_script01_1_M013 For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.
Ses02M_script01_1_M016 You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
Ses02M_script01_1_M017 You know.
Ses02M_script01_1_M018 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M021 See it isn't just my business-
Ses02M_script01_1_M024 I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.
Ses02M_script01_1_M025 To hell with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_M026 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses02M_script01_1_M027 Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.
Ses02M_script01_1_M028 I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M035 If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.
Ses02M_script01_1_M036 I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.
Ses02M_script01_1_M037 I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.
Ses02M_script01_1_M038 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses02M_script01_1_M039 Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
Ses02M_script01_1_M041 Yes, on this I would.
Ses02M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses02M_script01_2_F001 She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-
Ses02M_script01_2_F002 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses02M_script01_2_F003 He's not going to marry her.
Ses02M_script01_2_F005 What's going on here Joe?
Ses02M_script01_2_F006 -She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.
Ses02M_script01_2_F010 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense
Ses02M_script01_2_F013 I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.
Ses02M_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses02M_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking of it?
Ses02M_script01_2_M005 Well, so what?
Ses02M_script01_2_M007 You can't read her mind.
Ses02M_script01_2_M016 What does that mean, me above all?
Ses02M_script01_2_M017 Look at you -- look at you shaking.
Ses02M_script01_3_F001 It's all right.  It's a good thing.
Ses02M_script01_3_F002 You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.
Ses02M_script01_3_F003 No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.
Ses02M_script01_3_F007 I knew they would, your mother anyway.
Ses02M_script01_3_F008 Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?
Ses02M_script01_3_F009 I guess this is why I came.
Ses02M_script01_3_F012 Well, you started to write me
Ses02M_script01_3_F013 Every day since.
Ses02M_script01_3_F019 Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.
Ses02M_script01_3_F021 It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02M_script01_3_F025 Do you still feel that way?
Ses02M_script01_3_F026 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.
Ses02M_script01_3_F027 I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses02M_script01_3_F028 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02M_script01_3_M000 I know, it went out of style, didn't it?
Ses02M_script01_3_M010 I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
Ses02M_script01_3_M014 You felt something that far back?
Ses02M_script01_3_M015 Ann, why didn't you let me know?
Ses02M_script01_3_M020 Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses02M_script01_3_M021 No.  Nothing like that.
Ses02M_script01_3_M022 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses02M_script01_3_M025 Well, I lost them.
Ses02M_script01_3_M026 Just about all.
Ses02M_script01_3_M027 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
Ses02M_script01_3_M028 For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.
Ses02M_script01_3_M029 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses02M_script01_3_M030 I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?
Ses02M_script01_3_M031 To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
Ses02M_script01_3_M032 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
Ses02M_script01_3_M033 And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
Ses02M_script01_3_M034 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
Ses02M_script01_3_M035 Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.
Ses02M_script01_3_M036 I want you now Annie.
Ses02M_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses02M_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses02M_script02_1_F005 Yea.
Ses02M_script02_1_F006 I'm cold.
Ses02M_script02_1_F011 Not particularly.
Ses02M_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses02M_script02_1_F017 Yes.
Ses02M_script02_1_F018 Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.
Ses02M_script02_1_F020 That's the wind.
Ses02M_script02_1_F021 About what?
Ses02M_script02_1_M000 What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.
Ses02M_script02_1_M001 God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.
Ses02M_script02_1_M003 How you doing?
Ses02M_script02_1_M004 Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.
Ses02M_script02_1_M005 Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?
Ses02M_script02_1_M006 How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?
Ses02M_script02_1_M013 You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?
Ses02M_script02_1_M014 Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,
Ses02M_script02_1_M015 oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
Ses02M_script02_1_M016 You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses02M_script02_1_M023 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.
Ses02M_script02_1_M024 Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.
Ses02M_script02_1_M025 Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.
Ses02M_script02_1_M026 This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.
Ses02M_script02_1_M028 Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs
Ses02M_script02_1_M029 you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.
Ses02M_script02_1_M035 There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?
Ses02M_script02_1_M036 This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen.
Ses02M_script02_1_M037 Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,
Ses02M_script02_1_M038 they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.
Ses02M_script02_1_M039 Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses02M_script02_1_M040 It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,
Ses02M_script02_1_M041 they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses02M_script02_1_M042 Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.
Ses02M_script02_2_F005 Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
Ses02M_script02_2_F006 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02M_script02_2_F011 I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.
Ses02M_script02_2_F013 I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.
Ses02M_script02_2_F015 Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.
Ses02M_script02_2_F016 We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses02M_script02_2_F017 And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them
Ses02M_script02_2_F018 and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be
Ses02M_script02_2_F019 Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses02M_script02_2_F020 I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses02M_script02_2_F021 No.
Ses02M_script02_2_F022 No.
Ses02M_script02_2_F031 Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses02M_script02_2_F034 I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses02M_script02_2_F037 Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?
Ses02M_script02_2_F038 You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses02M_script02_2_F042 Well, I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses02M_script02_2_F044 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses02M_script02_2_F045 Or not.
Ses02M_script02_2_F046 Hmm.
Ses02M_script02_2_M000 So what do you think?
Ses02M_script02_2_M001 What I was saying.
Ses02M_script02_2_M002 Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses02M_script02_2_M010 Well, we'll see them this year.
Ses02M_script02_2_M015 You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said
Ses02M_script02_2_M016 "the Grunion are running tonight," I said "great, let's go, I feel lucky,"
Ses02M_script02_2_M017 okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-
Ses02M_script02_2_M019 It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?
Ses02M_script02_2_M020 Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?
Ses02M_script02_2_M021 Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?
Ses02M_script02_2_M022 You want to go get some champagne?
Ses02M_script02_2_M023 Take off our shoes?
Ses02M_script02_2_M025 Get married again?
Ses02M_script02_2_M029 Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?
Ses02M_script02_2_M035 No, I know. Me neither.
Ses02M_script02_2_M037 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses02M_script02_2_M038 No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.
Ses02M_script02_2_M040 Now that you mention it. No, I don't.
Ses02M_script02_2_M041 I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.
Ses02M_script02_2_M042 What have we got here?
Ses02M_script02_2_M045 Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses02M_script02_2_M046 Or not.
Ses02M_script03_1_F002 What are we going to do?
Ses02M_script03_1_F003 Now and always sweet.
Ses02M_script03_1_F005 Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.
Ses02M_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses02M_script03_1_F007 Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.
Ses02M_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses02M_script03_1_F015 Oh dear, should we like that?
Ses02M_script03_1_F021 Which particular one?
Ses02M_script03_1_F022 Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses02M_script03_1_F023 I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses02M_script03_1_F024 It went on intermittently for days.
Ses02M_script03_1_F025 It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02M_script03_1_F027 The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses02M_script03_1_F028 Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.
Ses02M_script03_1_F029 And very much sillier.
Ses02M_script03_1_M005 Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.
Ses02M_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise.
Ses02M_script03_1_M008 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?
Ses02M_script03_1_M009 Oh darling don't say that.
Ses02M_script03_1_M010 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?
Ses02M_script03_1_M011 What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?
Ses02M_script03_1_M012 You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.
Ses02M_script03_1_M014 flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.
Ses02M_script03_1_M015 Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.
Ses02M_script03_1_M016 No, that desire will fade along with our passion.
Ses02M_script03_1_M018 Yes, yes, with all his might.
Ses02M_script03_1_M019 No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.
Ses02M_script03_1_M020 So is everyone else in the long run.
Ses02M_script03_1_M021 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses02M_script03_1_M022 Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses02M_script03_1_M024 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses02M_script03_1_M029 That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses02M_script03_1_M031 I'll never forget his face.
Ses02M_script03_2_F000 You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses02M_script03_2_F001 Presents, just a trivial little broach.
Ses02M_script03_2_F002 No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses02M_script03_2_F003 No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses02M_script03_2_F005 What of it?
Ses02M_script03_2_F006 It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.
Ses02M_script03_2_F007 Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.
Ses02M_script03_2_F009 No thanks.
Ses02M_script03_2_F011 It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02M_script03_2_F012 Well, it's become a habit with you.
Ses02M_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses02M_script03_2_F015 No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses02M_script03_2_F019 Be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_F023 I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
Ses02M_script03_2_F024 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses02M_script03_2_F028 Oh be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_F035 You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.
Ses02M_script03_2_F036 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.
Ses02M_script03_2_F037 Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.
Ses02M_script03_2_F038 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.
Ses02M_script03_2_F039 This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.
Ses02M_script03_2_F040 Oh yes I am.
Ses02M_script03_2_F041 Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.
Ses02M_script03_2_F042 You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.
Ses02M_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses02M_script03_2_M003 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses02M_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you; you said you did.
Ses02M_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses02M_script03_2_M010 I have a little I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_M011 No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.
Ses02M_script03_2_M012 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
Ses02M_script03_2_M016 Going out somewhere, dear?
Ses02M_script03_2_M018 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
Ses02M_script03_2_M024 Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses02M_script03_2_M026 What riotous time you must have had.
Ses02M_script03_2_M027 No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.
Ses02M_script03_2_M031 We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.
Ses02M_script03_2_M032 All right. I will.
Ses02M_script03_2_M033 Better turn that off I think.
Ses02M_script03_2_M039 Turn it off.
Ses02M_script03_2_M040 Amanda, listen. Listen.
Ses02M_script03_2_M041 Very amusing indeed.
Ses02M_script03_2_M042 You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses02M_script03_2_M043 You're not going like this.
Ses02M_script03_2_M044 You're not.
Ses02M_script03_2_M045 Shut up.
Ses02M_script03_2_M046 Shut up.
Ses02M_script03_2_M047 I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses03F_impro01_F002 What's wrong?
Ses03F_impro01_M001 Oh, um-
Ses03F_impro01_M002 You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.
Ses03F_impro01_M003 Who?
Ses03F_impro01_M004 She- she probably doesn't even work here.
Ses03F_impro01_M005 All right  Uh-
Ses03F_impro02_F000 How's it going, babe?
Ses03F_impro02_F001 Yeah?
Ses03F_impro02_F005 oh.
Ses03F_impro02_F007 Well umm- actually they--I was promoted.
Ses03F_impro02_F008 And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.
Ses03F_impro02_F010 yeah.
Ses03F_impro02_F011 It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.
Ses03F_impro02_F012 yeah
Ses03F_impro02_F015 Yeah, and uh--
Ses03F_impro02_F018 Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.
Ses03F_impro02_F019 But it- it is for a year.
Ses03F_impro02_F020 Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.
Ses03F_impro02_F021 You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.
Ses03F_impro02_F023 Babe, I love you.
Ses03F_impro02_F024 But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.
Ses03F_impro02_F025 It's going to be okay.
Ses03F_impro02_F026 No, I have to go.
Ses03F_impro02_F027 Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.
Ses03F_impro02_F028 What do you mean?
Ses03F_impro02_F029 Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--
Ses03F_impro02_F031 and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--
Ses03F_impro02_F032 I will come back.
Ses03F_impro02_F034 we'll have all the money that we ever needed.
Ses03F_impro02_F035 And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.
Ses03F_impro02_F036 It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.
Ses03F_impro02_F037 Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.
Ses03F_impro02_F038 Don't do that to me.
Ses03F_impro02_F039 It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't.
Ses03F_impro02_F040 I know.
Ses03F_impro02_F041 I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.
Ses03F_impro02_F042 I'm sorry, babe.
Ses03F_impro02_F043 I'm so sorry.
Ses03F_impro02_M000 All right.
Ses03F_impro02_M001 She's doing fine. She just took her first steps today actually. I videotaped it for you so you can watch it.
Ses03F_impro02_M007 I can't- No, I can't do this alone.
Ses03F_impro02_M014 I have to work.
Ses03F_impro02_M016 You can't leave your daughter alone like this.
Ses03F_impro02_M017 You can't postpone it?
Ses03F_impro02_M018 I don't know if I can handle you going another year.
Ses03F_impro02_M019 I don't know if I- if I could take it.
Ses03F_impro02_M020 I can't be that strong. A whole year.
Ses03F_impro02_M021 me, oh my god.
Ses03F_impro02_M024 It doesn't look very good.
Ses03F_impro02_M025 I don't want the money. I want-you here
Ses03F_impro02_M027 If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.
Ses03F_impro02_M028 How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?
Ses03F_impro02_M029 How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.
Ses03F_impro02_M031 All right, then.
Ses03F_impro03_F004 at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and
Ses03F_impro03_F005 Joe's gone. -where did he go, you know?
Ses03F_impro03_F006 And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-
Ses03F_impro03_F007 he comes up onstage-- And the entire cast everyone just like
Ses03F_impro03_F008 goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.
Ses03F_impro03_F009 And I'm like freaking out. I'm like what the hell's going on, you know. I don't know what's going on. And so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone-
Ses03F_impro03_F011 he asked me to marry him, like- onstage. I was like, I couldn't believe--and I had to walk up there and I was, like I think I tripped or something.
Ses03F_impro03_F012 Yeah, I said yes, but I, yeah, I mean,
Ses03F_impro03_F013 I don't know- it just like took me, took me by surprise.
Ses03F_impro03_F014 He scored points.
Ses03F_impro03_F015 Oh, yeah. Everyone--yeah. And people--friends of ours were in the audience, I didn't know about, like family members.
Ses03F_impro03_F016 Yeah. It was great.
Ses03F_impro03_F017 It was--I cried,
Ses03F_impro03_F018 like a loser, I cried.
Ses03F_impro03_F019 But, I don't know, I--it's so weird to think I'm marrying somebody 'cause I feel so young, you know?
Ses03F_impro03_F020 No. No plans. or any- and probably
Ses03F_impro03_F021 like I think I want to get married--I want to have two weddings. One here, then one in Europe.
Ses03F_impro03_F024 Yeah. I'm so excited. [LAUGHTER].
Ses03F_impro03_M000 Oh, my God, look at that. Huh-oh, how many carats is that?
Ses03F_impro03_M001 Like eighteen? [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_impro03_M002 Oh, Jesus.
Ses03F_impro03_M005 yeah [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_impro03_M006 Yeah, The Lousy Chaperone. [LAUGHTER] Uh huh.
Ses03F_impro03_M007 [LAUGHTER] Uh- Drowsy.
Ses03F_impro03_M010 Oh, my God.
Ses03F_impro03_M015 No, you deserve to cry. I mean, tears of happiness.
Ses03F_impro03_M021 That's awesome. [LAUGHTER] Marriage.
Ses03F_impro04_F002 I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything.
Ses03F_impro04_F022 it's not funny. I just don't know what I'm going to do.
Ses03F_impro04_F023 Yeah, I guess I could.
Ses03F_impro04_F024 Yeah
Ses03F_impro04_M000 Hey, you just got to keep on going.
Ses03F_impro04_M001 No, don't think like that.
Ses03F_impro04_M002 Russel Crowe wasn't forty until he got his big stuff.
Ses03F_impro04_M003 If you really want to do it-I mean,
Ses03F_impro04_M004 you got to do.
Ses03F_impro04_M005 You could. You could. We just--
Ses03F_impro04_M006 we're just pooling our funds together.
Ses03F_impro04_M007 You don't owe me anything.
Ses03F_impro04_M008 You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared.
Ses03F_impro04_M009 Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that.
Ses03F_impro04_M010 You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five.
Ses03F_impro04_M011 Yeah.
Ses03F_impro04_M012 What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.
Ses03F_impro04_M013 See? So you can't just quit now.
Ses03F_impro04_M014 Have you been going to auditions and stuff?
Ses03F_impro04_M015 How's the job? Still waiting tables at Denny's?
Ses03F_impro04_M016 Well, they tip well.
Ses03F_impro04_M017 Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.
Ses03F_impro04_M018 Go back to school. You know? Another three more years, get your master's.
Ses03F_impro04_M019 Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough.
Ses03F_impro05_F002 Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?
Ses03F_impro05_F005 Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?
Ses03F_impro05_F007 What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.
Ses03F_impro05_F008 Not to mention I have my work in there.
Ses03F_impro05_F009 And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?
Ses03F_impro05_F010 Fifteen percent?
Ses03F_impro05_F011 What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.
Ses03F_impro05_F015 No, they said I couldn't lock it.
Ses03F_impro05_F016 Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.
Ses03F_impro05_F017 Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then.
Ses03F_impro05_M003 Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.
Ses03F_impro05_M008 and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.
Ses03F_impro05_M009 Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.
Ses03F_impro05_M011 I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.
Ses03F_impro05_M013 Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me.
Ses03F_impro05_M014 What, do you have questions?
Ses03F_impro06_F000 Okay.
Ses03F_impro06_F001 Yeah. Wow.
Ses03F_impro06_F002 Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F003 It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-
Ses03F_impro06_F004 he had cancer, you know?
Ses03F_impro06_F005 They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad.
Ses03F_impro06_F006 Turned around for the worst, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F007 He was amazing.
Ses03F_impro06_F008 I loved that boy.
Ses03F_impro06_F009 We did everything together, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F010 It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.
Ses03F_impro06_F011 He's so young. It seems so--
Ses03F_impro06_F012 so wrong in so many ways.
Ses03F_impro06_F013 His poor parents. You know, it's their only son.
Ses03F_impro06_F014 Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease.
Ses03F_impro06_F015 I know. He was, he had so much going for him.
Ses03F_impro06_F016 So handsome, so young, so gifted.
Ses03F_impro06_F017 So talented.
Ses03F_impro06_F018 Such a sweet person, you know?
Ses03F_impro06_F019 Not very good.
Ses03F_impro06_F020 Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.
Ses03F_impro06_F021 It's weird, I kind of feel like part of me is gone now, you know?
Ses03F_impro06_F022 Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.
Ses03F_impro06_F023 He was like, he was like my brother, you know.
Ses03F_impro06_F024 He was my brother.
Ses03F_impro06_F025 Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.
Ses03F_impro06_F026 You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and-
Ses03F_impro06_F027 Kelly. Kelly Uveny.
Ses03F_impro06_F028 They talked about getting married and--
Ses03F_impro06_F029 Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-
Ses03F_impro06_F030 so I was there for him.
Ses03F_impro06_F031 Yeah. God, I loved that kid.
Ses03F_impro06_F032 yeah.
Ses03F_impro06_F033 Joe, do you think he knew I loved him?
Ses03F_impro06_F034 I never told him, I love you, but-
Ses03F_impro06_F035 I loved him so much.
Ses03F_impro06_M000 How you doing?
Ses03F_impro06_M001 We're all going to miss him.
Ses03F_impro06_M002 I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.
Ses03F_impro06_M003 yeah.
Ses03F_impro06_M004 He was in chemo the whole time, right?
Ses03F_impro06_M005 And he just got that baseball scholarship.
Ses03F_impro06_M006 How's his parents doing?
Ses03F_impro06_M007 You guys were pretty close, weren't you?
Ses03F_impro06_M008 What was her name?
Ses03F_impro06_M009 Trying to have a baby.
Ses03F_impro06_M010 Some people.
Ses03F_impro06_M011 Yeah, but you were there all the hospital days. By his bed-
Ses03F_impro06_M012 So nice, so positive.
Ses03F_impro06_M013 We need more people like him.
Ses03F_impro06_M014 I don't know.
Ses03F_impro06_M015 I don't know if Benny was smart like that- but-
Ses03F_impro06_M016 I'm sure he loved you too. He just didn't know it.
Ses03F_impro07_F001 Uh-, So I got some good news.
Ses03F_impro07_F004 I have some better news than that.
Ses03F_impro07_F005 Yes, What would you want more than anything in this world?
Ses03F_impro07_F007 I got--U.S.C.. I got- Yeah, I got the acceptance letter.
Ses03F_impro07_F008 Yes, me, I got in. Thank you very much.
Ses03F_impro07_F009 Yeah, I know, my mom called me. I was with my girlfriend in Boston, and uh- she got the letter and she called me, she said I don't know, do you want me to open it? And I was like yes, open it. And she opened it and she goes oh, I'm sorry, Nat.
Ses03F_impro07_F011 And my mom was like Natalie, Natalie, it's [GARBAGE], you know-
Ses03F_impro07_F012 and so, I mean, I got in.
Ses03F_impro07_F013 So now I can stay here and now we can party. I know.
Ses03F_impro07_F014 Yeah, why not.
Ses03F_impro07_F015 We're not twenty one yet, but whatever.
Ses03F_impro07_F016 [LAUGHTER]. I'm so excited, Joe. Oh, man, I-- And I got in--I got into the school of theatre, so it's like-
Ses03F_impro07_F017 Yeah. It's really cool.
Ses03F_impro07_F019 Top five in the nation.
Ses03F_impro07_F020 Acting Pants? So what are you going to do? Are you--you're be--you're going to stay here, right?
Ses03F_impro07_F021 Awesome. We're both going to be in L.A.
Ses03F_impro07_F022 I'm so excited. Yeah, I thought I was going to go to Boston, but then--
Ses03F_impro07_F023 Oh man, I'm so excited. So much to do.
Ses03F_impro07_F025 I'm just so excited to start my life.
Ses03F_impro07_F026 Oh, and you sit down and you have the sponge bread-- --and eat the--drink the beer. Ugh, I love that stuff. I'm so excited.
Ses03F_impro07_F027 Are you going to come stay in my dorm with me sometime?
Ses03F_impro07_F028 Yeah. I'll get like one of those little--
Ses03F_impro07_F029 Yeah. Those little-- --mattresses. I'll put it by my bed.
Ses03F_impro07_F031 That's going to--that'll be reserved for somebody else.
Ses03F_impro07_F032 [LAUGHTER] Hello? I am not.
Ses03F_impro07_F034 [LAUGHTER]. No, you'd get used to it.
Ses03F_impro07_F035 [LAUGHTER]. Oh, Joe, I'm so happy.
Ses03F_impro07_M000 Hey, Isabella.
Ses03F_impro07_M001 I'm all right.
Ses03F_impro07_M003 You're not pregnant or anything.
Ses03F_impro07_M004 I know you've been trying to have a baby, right?
Ses03F_impro07_M008 Which one?
Ses03F_impro07_M011 Good for you.
Ses03F_impro07_M012 oh yeah.
Ses03F_impro07_M013 Oh, Jesus. That is so amazing.
Ses03F_impro07_M014 Party. You want to get drunk tonight?
Ses03F_impro07_M015 Yeah, we're going to celebrate.
Ses03F_impro07_M019 Who-whooooo. Miss Acti- Acting Pants.
Ses03F_impro07_M021 I got into film school at the Art Academy.
Ses03F_impro07_M022 So I'm going to be--yeah. I'm going to make films; you're going to be in them.
Ses03F_impro07_M023 Fuck Boston.
Ses03F_impro07_M025 We should uh- go to Little Ethiopia.
Ses03F_impro07_M026 Hell, yeah. Pass out.
Ses03F_impro07_M027 -drunk.
Ses03F_impro07_M028 No, I'll sleep in your bed. Cuddle up.
Ses03F_impro07_M029 Uh-oh.
Ses03F_impro07_M032 Yeah.
Ses03F_impro07_M033 Well, get used to it.
Ses03F_impro07_M034 Hey, I'm already getting used to it.
Ses03F_impro07_M035 Me too, Isabella.
Ses03F_impro08_F000 Hello sir, can I help you?
Ses03F_impro08_F001 I [GARBAGE]
Ses03F_impro08_F002 Yes, sir, I'm very sorry, but we've had some trouble here.  There's been a lot of calls and the system has-
Ses03F_impro08_F003 Sir, please calm down.  There's no reason to use profanity like that.  It's not-
Ses03F_impro08_F004 Okay, and this is for Verizon? Your provider?
Ses03F_impro08_F005 Well, um- we have a little problem with the system going on.  One of our satellites is down, and I-
Ses03F_impro08_F006 You're going to have to just be patient with us, sir, as we
Ses03F_impro08_F007 Well, I know sir, and we all are busy.
Ses03F_impro08_F008 But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information
Ses03F_impro08_F009 Okay, well, if you would like, um- we will be turning on the systems in probably about ten hours.
Ses03F_impro08_F010 Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use.
Ses03F_impro08_F011 Do you have a land line, sir?
Ses03F_impro08_F012 Okay, well, we will send you- We will reimburse you for the amount of minutes that you-
Ses03F_impro08_F013 -on average would use.
Ses03F_impro08_F014 And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir.
Ses03F_impro08_F015 No, we don't just give you things.  We're- we're-
Ses03F_impro08_F016 we compensating you for all your-
Ses03F_impro08_F020 Three days?
Ses03F_impro08_F021 A day?
Ses03F_impro08_F022 I don't know, sir.
Ses03F_impro08_F023 Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-
Ses03F_impro08_F024 Well, ten hours worth of minutes--
Ses03F_impro08_F025 is what's going to happen.
Ses03F_impro08_F026 Sir,
Ses03F_impro08_F027 what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-
Ses03F_impro08_F028 and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.
Ses03F_impro08_F029 Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.
Ses03F_impro08_M000 Hey, you stupid dumb shit machine, give me a fucking operator, huh?
Ses03F_impro08_M006 You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.
Ses03F_impro08_M007 -have to, have to what?
Ses03F_impro08_M008 What?  It's my phone.  You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.
Ses03F_impro08_M009 What?  Are you kidding me?
Ses03F_impro08_M010 Oh, my God.
Ses03F_impro08_M011 I- I'm going to kill myself right now.
Ses03F_impro08_M012 A free calling card?
Ses03F_impro08_M014 That's it? Okay, yeah.  What else?
Ses03F_impro08_M015 Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?
Ses03F_impro08_M021 About three million dollars.
Ses03F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses03F_script01_1_F005 He cried hard, huh?
Ses03F_script01_1_F007 Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?
Ses03F_script01_1_F010 What do you mean, dishonest?
Ses03F_script01_1_F014 They do come back.
Ses03F_script01_1_F017 It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.
Ses03F_script01_1_F019 Why?
Ses03F_script01_1_F021 Well, that's only your business, Chris.
Ses03F_script01_1_F030 You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.
Ses03F_script01_1_F031 There's nothing wrong with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_F045 Tell me something.
Ses03F_script01_1_F046 You'd leave that business.
Ses03F_script01_1_F050 I'm going to.
Ses03F_script01_1_F052 I don't know you, do I?
Ses03F_script01_1_F053 Yeah. I can see that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M001 He was out there when it happened.
Ses03F_script01_1_M002 Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.
Ses03F_script01_1_M003 I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03F_script01_1_M004 No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.
Ses03F_script01_1_M005 I could hear it right through the floor.
Ses03F_script01_1_M006 I guess he is.
Ses03F_script01_1_M007 I don't know.
Ses03F_script01_1_M008 But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses03F_script01_1_M009 Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses03F_script01_1_M016 You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?
Ses03F_script01_1_M017 You know.
Ses03F_script01_1_M018 I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03F_script01_1_M020 So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M021 See, then it's not just my business. God, you have
Ses03F_script01_1_M022 -Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.
Ses03F_script01_1_M026 Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.
Ses03F_script01_1_M027 To hell with that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M028 I didn't ask Annie yet.
Ses03F_script01_1_M029 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03F_script01_1_M030 Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.
Ses03F_script01_1_M031 I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?
Ses03F_script01_1_M034 Because it is.
Ses03F_script01_1_M036 It just is. I-
Ses03F_script01_1_M041 But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.
Ses03F_script01_1_M042 I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.
Ses03F_script01_1_M045 Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03F_script01_1_M046 Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M047 Now, where do I find it?
Ses03F_script01_1_M048 Yes. On this I would.
Ses03F_script01_1_M049 Then help me stay here.
Ses03F_script01_1_M050 Okay. Just-
Ses03F_script01_1_M052 I am thinking like that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M053 No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses03F_script01_2_F000 Why did you invite her here?
Ses03F_script01_2_F001 She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-
Ses03F_script01_2_F002 You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses03F_script01_2_F004 It's got that about it.
Ses03F_script01_2_F006 She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.
Ses03F_script01_2_F011 She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-
Ses03F_script01_2_F013 Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses03F_script01_2_F015 Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.
Ses03F_script01_2_F016 Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.
Ses03F_script01_2_F018 No, you've got to believe.
Ses03F_script01_2_F020 You got to keep believing.
Ses03F_script01_2_F021 I can't help it.
Ses03F_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses03F_script01_2_M003 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses03F_script01_2_M004 Well, so what?
Ses03F_script01_2_M006 You can't read her mind.
Ses03F_script01_2_M007 How do you know why she's waited?
Ses03F_script01_2_M008 Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?
Ses03F_script01_2_M009 Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_M011 All right. All right. Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_M013 Why me, above all?
Ses03F_script01_2_M014 Huh?
Ses03F_script01_2_M015 Why me above all?
Ses03F_script01_2_M016 Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses03F_script01_2_M017 What have I got to hide?
Ses03F_script01_2_M018 Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?
Ses03F_script01_3_F000 You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
Ses03F_script01_3_F001 No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.
Ses03F_script01_3_F002 It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.
Ses03F_script01_3_F003 No. I'm not sorry. It's-
Ses03F_script01_3_F008 Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.
Ses03F_script01_3_F011 Well, I mean,
Ses03F_script01_3_F012 from her opinion, why else would I come here?
Ses03F_script01_3_F013 Well, I guess that's why I came.
Ses03F_script01_3_F014 I've been ready for a long, long time.
Ses03F_script01_3_F018 Every day since.
Ses03F_script01_3_F021 I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses03F_script01_3_F023 Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.
Ses03F_script01_3_F025 No. What is it? Is it your mother?
Ses03F_script01_3_F026 Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.
Ses03F_script01_3_F027 You should tell me.
Ses03F_script01_3_F028 But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.
Ses03F_script01_3_F029 Yeah, sure.
Ses03F_script01_3_F030 How many?
Ses03F_script01_3_F031 Geez.
Ses03F_script01_3_F032 And you still feel that way?
Ses03F_script01_3_F033 Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.
Ses03F_script01_3_F035 What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03F_script01_3_M000 Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?
Ses03F_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses03F_script01_3_M003 Well-
Ses03F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses03F_script01_3_M006 Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.
Ses03F_script01_3_M009 I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.
Ses03F_script01_3_M010 Oh, Annie.
Ses03F_script01_3_M011 Annie, I love you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M012 I love you a great deal.
Ses03F_script01_3_M013 I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M014 I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.
Ses03F_script01_3_M015 I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.
Ses03F_script01_3_M018 You felt something that far back?
Ses03F_script01_3_M019 Why didn't you let me know?
Ses03F_script01_3_M020 Give me a kiss, Annie.
Ses03F_script01_3_M021 Give me-
Ses03F_script01_3_M023 We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03F_script01_3_M024 I kissed you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M025 Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M026 No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.
Ses03F_script01_3_M027 Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.
Ses03F_script01_3_M028 I don't know where to start.
Ses03F_script01_3_M029 You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.
Ses03F_script01_3_M030 Well, I lost them.
Ses03F_script01_3_M031 Just about all.
Ses03F_script01_3_M032 It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.
Ses03F_script01_3_M033 For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.
Ses03F_script01_3_M034 I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.
Ses03F_script01_3_M035 And I, and I thought something watching them go down.
Ses03F_script01_3_M036 Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?
Ses03F_script01_3_M037 And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03F_script01_3_M038 And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.
Ses03F_script01_3_M039 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.
Ses03F_script01_3_M040 And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.
Ses03F_script01_3_M041 Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M042 And I didn't want to take any of it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M043 And I guess that included you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M045 Annie,
Ses03F_script01_3_M046 Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses03F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses03F_script02_1_F003 I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?
Ses03F_script02_1_F010 Not particularly.
Ses03F_script02_1_F011 I don't know. I just don't.
Ses03F_script02_1_F012 Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
Ses03F_script02_1_M000 Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?
Ses03F_script02_1_M001 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
Ses03F_script02_1_M002 You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?
Ses03F_script02_1_M003 Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.
Ses03F_script02_1_M004 Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?
Ses03F_script02_1_M005 Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.
Ses03F_script02_1_M006 Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?
Ses03F_script02_1_M009 We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
Ses03F_script02_1_M010 I hope the moon stays out.
Ses03F_script02_1_M011 Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?
Ses03F_script02_1_M013 We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.
Ses03F_script02_1_M014 You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses03F_script02_1_M015 I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
Ses03F_script02_1_M016 I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
Ses03F_script02_1_M017 Do you want my jacket?
Ses03F_script02_1_M019 Right.
Ses03F_script02_1_M020 Yeah, that's my point too.
Ses03F_script02_1_M021 No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.
Ses03F_script02_1_M022 I mean, don't you want to see it?
Ses03F_script02_1_M023 Why not?
Ses03F_script02_1_M036 I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
Ses03F_script02_1_M038 And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses03F_script02_1_M039 You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.
Ses03F_script02_1_M040 its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.
Ses03F_script02_1_M041 They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
Ses03F_script02_1_M042 where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.
Ses03F_script02_1_M044 About what I just said.
Ses03F_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses03F_script02_2_F005 Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.
Ses03F_script02_2_F012 Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.
Ses03F_script02_2_F016 Do you remember the last time we came here?
Ses03F_script02_2_F017 We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03F_script02_2_F018 You brought a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F019 We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.
Ses03F_script02_2_F020 And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.
Ses03F_script02_2_F021 Oh, that moment-that was it.
Ses03F_script02_2_F022 I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.
Ses03F_script02_2_F023 Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_F024 I don't want to remember something.
Ses03F_script02_2_F025 Hope for some things.
Ses03F_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F027 No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F028 No, no.
Ses03F_script02_2_F031 No.
Ses03F_script02_2_F035 No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.
Ses03F_script02_2_F036 Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.
Ses03F_script02_2_F038 it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03F_script02_2_F039 I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.
Ses03F_script02_2_F040 I didn't say that.
Ses03F_script02_2_F043 Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.
Ses03F_script02_2_F044 I noticed that. It's beautiful.
Ses03F_script02_2_F045 You can see right over the water.
Ses03F_script02_2_F048 At least we won't need glasses.
Ses03F_script02_2_F050 Maybe this is the right place after all.
Ses03F_script02_2_F051 I'm sorry, Augie.
Ses03F_script02_2_M001 About what I was just saying.
Ses03F_script02_2_M005 Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
Ses03F_script02_2_M008 We're not seeing the grunions?
Ses03F_script02_2_M016 Wait a minute. I got it.
Ses03F_script02_2_M026 A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?
Ses03F_script02_2_M038 Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.
Ses03F_script02_2_M039 Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.
Ses03F_script02_2_M040 Look what we got here.
Ses03F_script02_2_M041 It's not champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_M042 Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?
Ses03F_script02_2_M043 Shh.
Ses03F_script02_2_M044 If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03F_script02_2_M045 Or not.
Ses03F_script03_1_F000 [BREATHING]
Ses03F_script03_1_F001 Do you think it's them?
Ses03F_script03_1_F009 Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
Ses03F_script03_1_F014 Oh dear, well, shall we want that?
Ses03F_script03_1_F015 Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses03F_script03_1_F019 Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.
Ses03F_script03_1_F021 Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses03F_script03_1_F025 yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses03F_script03_1_F026 The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_script03_1_F027 I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.
Ses03F_script03_1_M004 We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.
Ses03F_script03_1_M005 Then I don't care.
Ses03F_script03_1_M007 things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses03F_script03_1_M011 [LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.
Ses03F_script03_1_M013 Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.
Ses03F_script03_1_M020 Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses03F_script03_1_M022 Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses03F_script03_1_M027 That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses03F_script03_2_F004 Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.
Ses03F_script03_2_F008 Well, it's true.
Ses03F_script03_2_F013 It's become a habit with you.
Ses03F_script03_2_F014 Don't be so stupid.
Ses03F_script03_2_F015 What?
Ses03F_script03_2_F017 It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?
Ses03F_script03_2_F018 No, it isn't.
Ses03F_script03_2_F023 I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.
Ses03F_script03_2_F026 You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_F035 Turn it on.
Ses03F_script03_2_F037 I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.
Ses03F_script03_2_F038 Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses03F_script03_2_F039 Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.
Ses03F_script03_2_F040 This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.
Ses03F_script03_2_F041 Oh, yes I am.
Ses03F_script03_2_F042 Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.
Ses03F_script03_2_F043 Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.
Ses03F_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses03F_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses03F_script03_2_M002 I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.
Ses03F_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you. You said so.
Ses03F_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses03F_script03_2_M008 That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses03F_script03_2_M009 Are you bored with this conversation?
Ses03F_script03_2_M010 So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?
Ses03F_script03_2_M011 I'll have a little, I think.
Ses03F_script03_2_M012 No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.
Ses03F_script03_2_M014 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.
Ses03F_script03_2_M015 Really, Amanda.
Ses03F_script03_2_M016 Nothing.
Ses03F_script03_2_M017 Going somewhere, dear?
Ses03F_script03_2_M020 Yes, it is.
Ses03F_script03_2_M024 They snap.
Ses03F_script03_2_M026 did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses03F_script03_2_M027 I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?
Ses03F_script03_2_M028 You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.
Ses03F_script03_2_M029 I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_M030 Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_M034 Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.
Ses03F_script03_2_M035 This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses03F_script03_2_M038 Turn it off.
Ses03F_script03_2_M039 Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-
Ses03F_script03_2_M040 Very amusing indeed.
Ses03F_script03_2_M041 You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses03F_script03_2_M042 No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.
Ses03F_script03_2_M043 Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Ses03F_script03_2_M044 I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.
Ses03M_impro01_F000 Is that a demand sir?
Ses03M_impro01_F003 No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.
Ses03M_impro01_F022 Okay.  I'm going to call security. Security!
Ses03M_impro01_F025 This entire time you're fighting with me sir, you could've finished the form and already been half way-- No.  Get out.
Ses03M_impro01_M004 What are you talking about?  It says fill out that part.
Ses03M_impro01_M011 I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying right here.
Ses03M_impro01_M012 Hey,uh-- Well that's too bad cause I'm getting my license right now.
Ses03M_impro01_M014 Hey, no, give me that back.
Ses03M_impro01_M015 -- No.  I'm not waiting...I'm not coming back again.  I don't have time to come back five days.
Ses03M_impro01_M017 Yes I will.  I'll have this [GARBAGE]
Ses03M_impro01_M019 Fine.  Call your supervisor.  Ask supervisor over
Ses03M_impro01_M023 No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here-- I am filling out right now okay just calm down. I'm filling out right now-- Just take the god damn piece of paper.
Ses03M_impro01_M028 I did finish one.  Take it.
Ses03M_impro01_M029 What is wrong with you?
Ses03M_impro02_F000 Um.
Ses03M_impro02_F003 Why the sad face?
Ses03M_impro02_F013 Do this whole thing by myself?
Ses03M_impro02_F014 Carry her for nine months and then yes.
Ses03M_impro02_F015 It's not the same thing.  It's not like having you here.
Ses03M_impro02_F016 I can't do this.
Ses03M_impro02_F017 I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.
Ses03M_impro02_F022 and watch our child grow, see her take her first steps, her first words.
Ses03M_impro02_F023 You said two years.
Ses03M_impro02_F024 A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.
Ses03M_impro02_F025 What could happen in a year?
Ses03M_impro02_F026 And this isn't the first time you know?  I mean you always...sending you off to different places and...
Ses03M_impro02_F027 I don't know if that's how I want to live my life.
Ses03M_impro02_F028 Joe I'm serious I don't want to have to have a little girl to tell...asking every day where's daddy, where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away--
Ses03M_impro02_F029 far away and he won't be here.
Ses03M_impro02_F030 I'm done.  I can't honey.
Ses03M_impro02_F031 It's over.
Ses03M_impro02_F032 Honey I can't do it anymore.
Ses03M_impro02_F033 I need you here.  Anna needs you.
Ses03M_impro02_F034 yeah.

Ses03M_impro02_M001 Hey.
Ses03M_impro02_M002 Uh, -Um
Ses03M_impro02_M003 they need me out there sooner than I thought
Ses03M_impro02_M004 They want to deploy me next week.
Ses03M_impro02_M005 For--
Ses03M_impro02_M006 They said anywhere from two to three years.
Ses03M_impro02_M011 No.
Ses03M_impro02_M012 Honey you're not going to be by yourself--
Ses03M_impro02_M013 We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything.  My whole family's here too.
Ses03M_impro02_M015 You can do it.  Alright?  You can, you can be strong, you can be strong for both of us alright?
Ses03M_impro02_M016 I don't know what to do.
Ses03M_impro02_M019 You know I can't say no.
Ses03M_impro02_M024 Honey after a year I can be back.
Ses03M_impro02_M025 They want me there two years but I could probably get
Ses03M_impro02_M026 maybe get some vacation-- --once it quiets down there.
Ses03M_impro02_M027 I know.  I know.  But they really need some good guys there.
Ses03M_impro02_M028 Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.
Ses03M_impro02_M029 It's just going to be--it's going to go faster than you think.
Ses03M_impro02_M030 You tell her-- [BREATHING]
Ses03M_impro02_M031 What do you mean?
Ses03M_impro03_F001 What?
Ses03M_impro03_F003 Chuck E. Cheese?  Ah, man that is so lame.
Ses03M_impro03_F004 Are you serious [GARBAGE] man?
Ses03M_impro03_F005 Oh like that one movie.  What's that one movie I just saw? No.  Where she like swallows the...

Ses03M_impro03_F010 [LAUGHTER] So nasty. No you... dirty me?
Ses03M_impro03_F012 She actually asked if it was real?  I would've probably asked the same thing considering you were in Chuck E. Cheese.

Ses03M_impro03_F016 Oh god! You are damn cheap, cheap, cheap. Anyways, moving on. It's not like you're poor.  I mean your dad makes... okey

Ses03M_impro03_F023 Wait, wait, wait I want you to marry me?  No, shouldn't you like be more like a question like, would you marry me?  Not like I want you to marry me.  It's like a demand.
Ses03M_impro03_F024 You marry me. I man I Jane, you Tarzan.
Ses03M_impro03_F025 She said sure?
Ses03M_impro03_F026 Sure?  Who says sure?  You say yes...I don't like--

Ses03M_impro05a_M001 Yeah.  You do that.  I'm coming from Baltimore.  You know where that is?

Ses03M_impro06_F001 Hanging in there?
Ses03M_impro06_F002 So sad.
Ses03M_impro06_F003 Yeah.

Ses03M_impro06_F014 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro06_F015 I'm so sorry.
Ses03M_impro06_F016 Well now you can follow his footsteps, you know?  Carry out what he wanted to do.
Ses03M_impro06_F017 Well sure you could.
Ses03M_impro06_F018 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro06_F019 I would've loved to.
Ses03M_impro06_F020 Now I can't.
Ses03M_impro06_M000 I ah--
Ses03M_impro06_M001 alright.
Ses03M_impro06_M002 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro06_M003 It just feels like I was talking to him yesterday.
Ses03M_impro06_M004 He was my only friend growing up.
Ses03M_impro06_M005 no one else would talk to me but he would.
Ses03M_impro06_M006 He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.
Ses03M_impro06_M007 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro06_M008 You know I was always the one to tell him to be more wild you know?
Ses03M_impro06_M009 And he just took it overboard.
Ses03M_impro06_M010 You know a stupid case of drunk driving it's just...
Ses03M_impro06_M011 and the worst part of it is that he was in the car with his girlfriend,
Ses03M_impro06_M012 his girlfriend got killed too.
Ses03M_impro06_M013 And the car that he hit was his family.
Ses03M_impro06_M014 The mother and father died--
Ses03M_impro06_M015 and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now.
Ses03M_impro06_M016 and just going to the funeral it's-
Ses03M_impro06_M017 -do I miss him or do I hate him, you know?
Ses03M_impro06_M018 I was supposed to see him last summer
Ses03M_impro06_M019 then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by
Ses03M_impro06_M020 and then something like this happens you know?
Ses03M_impro06_M021 I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months.
Ses03M_impro06_M022 He's supposed to be my best friend.
Ses03M_impro06_M023 It's so fucked up.
Ses03M_impro06_M024 Why is that?
Ses03M_impro06_M025 He was studying to be a doctor.
Ses03M_impro06_M026 I mean he was...he wanted to help people in poor countries, that is his goal.  He didn't care about the money.  He just wanted to go and help people.
Ses03M_impro06_M027 What the...what am I doing?
Ses03M_impro06_M028 Working for corporate America?  Wow.
Ses03M_impro06_M029 He actually wanted to do something.
Ses03M_impro06_M030 I can't do that.
Ses03M_impro06_M031 You should've met him.
Ses03M_impro06_M032 He is the greatest...everyone liked him.
Ses03M_impro07_F000 Hey.  How's it going?  I haven't seen you in awhile.
Ses03M_impro07_F001 What's going on Joe?
Ses03M_impro07_F006 You're going to be here and I'm going to be in LA so we can be together now.  I mean we can be in the same city.
Ses03M_impro07_F007 We can party.  We can have fun.
Ses03M_impro07_F008 Yeah.  Hopefully it won't be like high school.
Ses03M_impro07_F009 Oh man I am so proud of you, that is...how did you get...I mean what did you do?  How did you find out or what...?
Ses03M_impro07_F010 Oh man.
Ses03M_impro07_F011 Did you say yes yet?  I mean have you sent in your answer?
Ses03M_impro07_F012 All right.
Ses03M_impro07_F013 This is so great, you know, because I gone fit on downtown so I'm going to be like right here.  I think I'm going to be living at City Lights downtown.
Ses03M_impro07_F014 Yeah, it really is.

Ses03M_impro07_F017 Well, I'm happy for you but I'm happy for me cause that means you're going to stay.
Ses03M_impro07_F018 Oh great. I would love to go.
Ses03M_impro07_F019 Mmmm some miso soup.

Ses03M_impro07_M006 I got into cinema production.
Ses03M_impro07_M007 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro07_M008 No.  It's like it's harder than getting into Harvard.
Ses03M_impro07_M009 What does that mean?
Ses03M_impro07_M010 Holy shit...
Ses03M_impro07_M011 This will be like high school but even better.
Ses03M_impro07_M013 I have some bad news.  I was like what?  She's like not really you got into U.S.C. and I was like, I was like oh my God.  I was about to tear my own hair out.
Ses03M_impro07_M014 Yeah.  This is so crazy.  I mean I didn't get into any other school but I got into the school I wanted.
Ses03M_impro07_M015 Oh my God the first minute I got it I sent it back in.
Ses03M_impro07_M016 So...
Ses03M_impro07_M017 This is so exciting.  This is like a new chapter in our lives.
Ses03M_impro07_M018 We're doing what we want to do, then four years later we're going to be working professionals, making money, sipping martinis every day.
Ses03M_impro07_M019 Thank you
Ses03M_impro07_M020 And tonight my parents want to take me out to sushi and they said I could bring you.
Ses03M_impro07_M022 Yeah and they said get whatever you want and...
Ses03M_impro07_M023 Some miso soup.  You can get whatever.  You can get a vat full of miso soup.  God.
Ses03M_impro07_M024 This is going to be so great.  I have so many great ideas.
Ses03M_impro07_M025 It took them, oh man, it took them like, I mean what it's like April now and any letters that come in April are usually the rejection letters so I was just like...
Ses03M_impro08a_F004 two two six six.

Ses03M_impro08a_F014 I want to talk to a supervisor
Ses03M_impro08a_F015 I would like to talk to your supervisor.  Obviously you're incompetent and don't understand what I'm asking.
Ses03M_impro08a_F020 This is ridiculous.Well what are we supposed to do?  We starve then because I can't use my phone cause
Ses03M_impro08a_F021 I am a realtor and this is my business.  People are calling me all the time but you know, and I don't have a land line.  I can't afford to have a land line
Ses03M_impro08a_F022 That you better be sorry.

Ses03M_impro08a_M005 So what exactly is the problem?

Ses03M_impro08a_M008 No.  Okay.  We're not charging you for any of these months.  We're going to give you three months free.

Ses03M_impro08b_M004 Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?

Ses03M_impro08b_M007 Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-
Ses03M_impro08b_M008 Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--

Ses03M_impro08b_M022 Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.
Ses03M_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.
Ses03M_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses03M_script01_1_F005 He cried hard?
Ses03M_script01_1_F008 He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?
Ses03M_script01_1_F016 No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.
Ses03M_script01_1_F017 Why?
Ses03M_script01_1_F020 Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses03M_script01_1_F021 Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--
Ses03M_script01_1_F028 Did you ask Annie yet?
Ses03M_script01_1_F030 Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...
Ses03M_script01_1_F038 You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.
Ses03M_script01_1_F040 Tell me something.  You can leave this business?
Ses03M_script01_1_F043 I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.
Ses03M_script01_1_F045 I don't understand you do I?
Ses03M_script01_1_F046 Yeah.  I can see that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M001 He was out there when it happened.
Ses03M_script01_1_M002 About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
Ses03M_script01_1_M003 I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03M_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.
Ses03M_script01_1_M005 I could hear it right through the floor.
Ses03M_script01_1_M006 I guess he is.
Ses03M_script01_1_M007 I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses03M_script01_1_M009 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.
Ses03M_script01_1_M011 Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?
Ses03M_script01_1_M012 That we haven't had any hope for years now?
Ses03M_script01_1_M017 You know why I asked Annie here, right?
Ses03M_script01_1_M019 I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M021 Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M022 Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses03M_script01_1_M027 Well to hell with that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M028 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03M_script01_1_M029 Then I guess that's the end of it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M030 But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
Ses03M_script01_1_M031 And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M036 I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
Ses03M_script01_1_M037 But if I can't have that here I'll get out.
Ses03M_script01_1_M038 I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.
Ses03M_script01_1_M039 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M040 The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M041 Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03M_script01_1_M043 Yes.  On this I would.
Ses03M_script01_1_M045 I know.  Just you help me stay here.
Ses03M_script01_1_M046 I am thinking like that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M047 No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses03M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses03M_script01_2_F001 Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.
Ses03M_script01_2_F006 No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.
Ses03M_script01_2_F009 I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.
Ses03M_script01_2_F010 My worst times I think about her, you know, and I
Ses03M_script01_2_F011 it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.
Ses03M_script01_2_F012 No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.
Ses03M_script01_2_F015 Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.
Ses03M_script01_2_F017 Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.
Ses03M_script01_2_F019 I can't help it.
Ses03M_script01_2_M001 Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses03M_script01_2_M004 Who said he even thought about that?
Ses03M_script01_2_M005 Well, so what?
Ses03M_script01_2_M008 How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?
Ses03M_script01_2_M014 Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?
Ses03M_script01_2_M015 Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?
Ses03M_script01_2_M016 Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses03M_script01_2_M017 What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?
Ses03M_script01_3_F004 No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses03M_script01_3_F006 Look,
Ses03M_script01_3_F007 you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...
Ses03M_script01_3_F008 Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.
Ses03M_script01_3_F011 Well,
Ses03M_script01_3_F012 I guess that's why I came.
Ses03M_script01_3_F013 Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.
Ses03M_script01_3_F014 Look, I almost got married two years ago.
Ses03M_script01_3_F015 You started to write me.
Ses03M_script01_3_F016 Every day since.
Ses03M_script01_3_F017 I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?
Ses03M_script01_3_F018 You'd always be so ambiguous.
Ses03M_script01_3_F019 I'll never forgive you for that.
Ses03M_script01_3_F020 I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
Ses03M_script01_3_F021 Not like that you're not.
Ses03M_script01_3_F029 How many?
Ses03M_script01_3_F030 Geez.
Ses03M_script01_3_F031 And you still feel that way?
Ses03M_script01_3_F033 that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses03M_script01_3_F034 What am I going to do with a fortune?
Ses03M_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses03M_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses03M_script01_3_M008 I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.
Ses03M_script01_3_M010 I love you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M016 You felt something that far back.
Ses03M_script01_3_M018 Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...
Ses03M_script01_3_M019 Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.
Ses03M_script01_3_M021 We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03M_script01_3_M023 Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M027 You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses03M_script01_3_M028 Well I lost them.
Ses03M_script01_3_M029 Just about all.
Ses03M_script01_3_M030 Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.
Ses03M_script01_3_M031 For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.
Ses03M_script01_3_M032 That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.
Ses03M_script01_3_M033 A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.
Ses03M_script01_3_M034 It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?
Ses03M_script01_3_M035 And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03M_script01_3_M036 And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.
Ses03M_script01_3_M037 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.
Ses03M_script01_3_M038 It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,
Ses03M_script01_3_M039 open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
Ses03M_script01_3_M040 cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.
Ses03M_script01_3_M041 Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.
Ses03M_script01_3_M042 And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M045 Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M046 Buy some hats?
Ses03M_script02_1_F005 Yes.
Ses03M_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses03M_script02_1_M000 Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?
Ses03M_script02_1_M001 Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.
Ses03M_script02_1_M002 You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?
Ses03M_script02_1_M003 Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.
Ses03M_script02_1_M004 But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?
Ses03M_script02_1_M005 Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.
Ses03M_script02_1_M014 God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.
Ses03M_script02_1_M015 I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]
Ses03M_script02_1_M016 I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses03M_script02_1_M017 Do you want my jacket?
Ses03M_script02_1_M023 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.
Ses03M_script02_1_M024 Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.
Ses03M_script02_1_M025 But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.
Ses03M_script02_1_M026 Yeah they do.
Ses03M_script02_1_M027 Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.
Ses03M_script02_1_M034 Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?
Ses03M_script02_1_M035 You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.
Ses03M_script02_1_M036 I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
Ses03M_script02_1_M037 Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...
Ses03M_script02_1_M038 ...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses03M_script02_1_M039 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.
Ses03M_script02_1_M040 They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses03M_script02_1_M041 Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.
Ses03M_script02_1_M042 [BREATHING] So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_1_M043 About what I just said?
Ses03M_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses03M_script02_2_F001 It's ridiculous.
Ses03M_script02_2_F002 It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.
Ses03M_script02_2_F003 Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.
Ses03M_script02_2_F004 Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.
Ses03M_script02_2_F009 Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.
Ses03M_script02_2_F011 Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses03M_script02_2_F013 Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.
Ses03M_script02_2_F016 No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.
Ses03M_script02_2_F018 We thought I was pregnant.
Ses03M_script02_2_F023 I'd rather not remember something...
Ses03M_script02_2_F024 Rather not hope for something.
Ses03M_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses03M_script02_2_F031 I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
Ses03M_script02_2_F033 Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.
Ses03M_script02_2_F034 This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Ses03M_script02_2_F035 I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.
Ses03M_script02_2_F036 I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses03M_script02_2_F037 I didn't say that.
Ses03M_script02_2_F038 Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.
Ses03M_script02_2_F040 If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.
Ses03M_script02_2_F041 Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.
Ses03M_script02_2_F042 Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.
Ses03M_script02_2_F044 Oh you brought refreshments.
Ses03M_script02_2_F046 No I'm beginning to think you might be right.
Ses03M_script02_2_F047 I think this may be the place for us after all.
Ses03M_script02_2_F048 I am sorry Augie.
Ses03M_script02_2_F049 Or not.
Ses03M_script02_2_M000 So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_2_M014 Well, we're going to see it.
Ses03M_script02_2_M017 Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.
Ses03M_script02_2_M019 Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses03M_script02_2_M020 It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...
Ses03M_script02_2_M021 And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.
Ses03M_script02_2_M022 You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?
Ses03M_script02_2_M028 Welcome to the human race.
Ses03M_script02_2_M029 Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M030 I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...
Ses03M_script02_2_M031 ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.
Ses03M_script02_2_M032 Yes it is.
Ses03M_script02_2_M033 Right.
Ses03M_script02_2_M036 Maybe if you were with someone else too.
Ses03M_script02_2_M037 I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
Ses03M_script02_2_M041 I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.
Ses03M_script02_2_M042 Hey, look what we got here.
Ses03M_script02_2_M045 Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03M_script02_2_M046 Or not.
Ses03M_script03_1_F003 Now and always sweet.
Ses03M_script03_1_F004 I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.
Ses03M_script03_1_F005 That sent shivers up my spine.
Ses03M_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses03M_script03_1_F018 That's serious enough.
Ses03M_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses03M_script03_1_M006 No, wrong number.
Ses03M_script03_1_M035 I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses03M_script03_2_F000 Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.
Ses03M_script03_2_F001 Presents?  A trivial little broach.
Ses03M_script03_2_F003 No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.
Ses03M_script03_2_F004 Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.
Ses03M_script03_2_F006 Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.
Ses03M_script03_2_F010 I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
Ses03M_script03_2_F011 I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_F012 It's become a habit with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses03M_script03_2_F016 No, just making myself beautiful for you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F017 That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?
Ses03M_script03_2_F024 Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses03M_script03_2_F025 They sting.
Ses03M_script03_2_F028 Mind your business.
Ses03M_script03_2_F029 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_F030 You've always had a weak head.
Ses03M_script03_2_F031 On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.
Ses03M_script03_2_F032 Shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_F033 Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.
Ses03M_script03_2_F036 They are away in Tunis.
Ses03M_script03_2_F038 Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.
Ses03M_script03_2_F039 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses03M_script03_2_F040 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses03M_script03_2_F041 I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.
Ses03M_script03_2_F042 This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.
Ses03M_script03_2_F043 Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.
Ses03M_script03_2_F044 Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-
Ses03M_script03_2_F045 Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.
Ses03M_script03_2_M000 Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_M003 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_M004 You must admit he was in love with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?
Ses03M_script03_2_M006 And what about me?
Ses03M_script03_2_M007 Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses03M_script03_2_M008 Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.
Ses03M_script03_2_M009 You want some brandy?
Ses03M_script03_2_M010 I'll have a little I think.
Ses03M_script03_2_M011 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses03M_script03_2_M012 Oh my...just because I just...okay...
Ses03M_script03_2_M014 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
Ses03M_script03_2_M019 Actually that's perfectly true.
Ses03M_script03_2_M020 Yes it is.
Ses03M_script03_2_M021 I think that
Ses03M_script03_2_M029 I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_M030 Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_M031 Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?
Ses03M_script03_2_M032 We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.
Ses03M_script03_2_M033 Oh, thanks.  I think I will.
Ses03M_script03_2_M034 You better turn that off.
Ses03M_script03_2_M038 No I'll do no such thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_M039 Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses03M_script03_2_M040 Turn it--Turn it off.
Ses03M_script03_2_M041 Very amusing indeed.
Ses03M_script03_2_M042 You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.
Ses03M_script03_2_M043 You're not going nowhere. No you're not.
Ses03M_script03_2_M044 Just shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_M045 shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.
Ses03M_script03_2_M046 Oh.
Ses04F_impro01_F004 I did exactly what they told me to do.
Ses04F_impro01_F008 I've been to the back of the line five times.
Ses04F_impro01_F009 Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?
Ses04F_impro01_F010 Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.
Ses04F_impro01_F012 I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.
Ses04F_impro01_F014 I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.
Ses04F_impro01_F016 This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.
Ses04F_impro01_F019 I'm testing your patience?
Ses04F_impro01_F021 I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.
Ses04F_impro01_F022 Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.
Ses04F_impro01_M005 I've got a life too ma'am
Ses04F_impro01_M008 There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.
Ses04F_impro01_M011 You're going to have to go back again.
Ses04F_impro01_M014 Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.
Ses04F_impro01_M021 like I said before right now.
Ses04F_impro01_M023 You're testing my goddamn patience.
Ses04F_impro01_M024 I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?
Ses04F_impro02_F000 Yeah.  They just called.
Ses04F_impro02_F001 I know.
Ses04F_impro02_F002 I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.
Ses04F_impro02_F003 I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.
Ses04F_impro02_F005 Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.
Ses04F_impro02_F006 Do you think I want to leave you?
Ses04F_impro02_F007 I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?
Ses04F_impro02_F009 And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.
Ses04F_impro02_F011 What's that supposed to mean?
Ses04F_impro02_F012 Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?
Ses04F_impro02_F017 Thanks that helps.
Ses04F_impro02_F018 I feel much better now.
Ses04F_impro02_F022 That's how you want to leave it?
Ses04F_impro02_F023 I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.
Ses04F_impro02_F024 Fine.
Ses04F_impro02_M000 So you're leaving tomorrow.
Ses04F_impro02_M001 This is really-this is unfair.
Ses04F_impro02_M004 And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.
Ses04F_impro02_M012 I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.
Ses04F_impro02_M018 That's all I'm saying... No you don't.
Ses04F_impro02_M020 You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.
Ses04F_impro02_M021 Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-
Ses04F_impro02_M024 I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?
Ses04F_impro02_M025 You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?
Ses04F_impro02_M026 Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.
Ses04F_impro03_F000 I have something to tell you.
Ses04F_impro03_F001 It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?
Ses04F_impro03_F002 Look.
Ses04F_impro03_F003 Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.
Ses04F_impro03_F004 I know. I'm so-
Ses04F_impro03_F005 Thank you. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro03_F006 You think. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro03_F007 Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.
Ses04F_impro03_F009 We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro03_F010 Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff.
Ses04F_impro03_F011 So pretty.
Ses04F_impro03_F012 Very Midsummer Night's wedding.
Ses04F_impro03_F013 Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.
Ses04F_impro03_F014 Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help
Ses04F_impro03_F015 plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.
Ses04F_impro03_F016 Yeah?
Ses04F_impro03_F017 Really?
Ses04F_impro03_F018 Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time.
Ses04F_impro03_F034 Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.
Ses04F_impro03_F036 Yes.
Ses04F_impro03_F038 because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.
Ses04F_impro03_F040 Ha ha ha.
Ses04F_impro03_F041 Ha ha.
Ses04F_impro03_F042 Just couldn't be any cooler.
Ses04F_impro03_F043 I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.
Ses04F_impro03_F044 You don't look like you're going to faint.
Ses04F_impro03_F045 So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?
Ses04F_impro03_F047 You haven't ruined it yet.
Ses04F_impro03_F048 You really like
Ses04F_impro03_F050 You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.
Ses04F_impro03_F051 [LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.
Ses04F_impro03_F052 [laughter]
Ses04F_impro03_M000 What?  You seem so excited.
Ses04F_impro03_M001 Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.
Ses04F_impro03_M003 Holy shit that's amazing.
Ses04F_impro03_M004 Congratulations.
Ses04F_impro03_M005 I'm invited, right.
Ses04F_impro03_M014 Yeah.  I'll help plan.
Ses04F_impro03_M018 Why not browns?
Ses04F_impro03_M019 It's a light brown, tanish.
Ses04F_impro03_M020 I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-
Ses04F_impro03_M021 I know but you just asked me to-
Ses04F_impro03_M027 Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?
Ses04F_impro03_M028 Blue?
Ses04F_impro03_M029 Okay, fine. Greens and blues.
Ses04F_impro03_M030 Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?
Ses04F_impro03_M031 Yeah?
Ses04F_impro03_M032 Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?
Ses04F_impro03_M033 I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.
Ses04F_impro03_M034 Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.
Ses04F_impro03_M035 Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.
Ses04F_impro03_M036 Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.
Ses04F_impro03_M037 I'm thrilled.  God.
Ses04F_impro03_M038 Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend
Ses04F_impro03_M039 You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing
Ses04F_impro03_M040 Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.
Ses04F_impro03_M041 I'm so- all the blood
Ses04F_impro03_M042 has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.
Ses04F_impro03_M043 I'm getting a little weak in the knees.
Ses04F_impro03_M047 I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.
Ses04F_impro04_F000 That's helpful.
Ses04F_impro04_F005 I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.
Ses04F_impro04_F006 What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.
Ses04F_impro04_F008 Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.
Ses04F_impro04_F011 Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_F013 I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.
Ses04F_impro04_F014 I mean it's not like this is an
Ses04F_impro04_F015 extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.
Ses04F_impro04_F016 Okay. Okay, Fine.
Ses04F_impro04_F017 Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?
Ses04F_impro04_F018 I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-
Ses04F_impro04_F025 Well you- just you're doing something wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_F030 What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.
Ses04F_impro04_F031 I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.
Ses04F_impro04_M001 Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.
Ses04F_impro04_M002 Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.
Ses04F_impro04_M003 I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-
Ses04F_impro04_M004 I don't know.
Ses04F_impro04_M005 Hey.  Look, I mean- you know.
Ses04F_impro04_M006 Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.
Ses04F_impro04_M007 You need that- Time-
Ses04F_impro04_M008 You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M009 look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M013 I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.
Ses04F_impro04_M014 Yeah, I understand, but-
Ses04F_impro04_M015 I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M016 Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_M017 'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-
Ses04F_impro04_M018 Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?
Ses04F_impro04_M019 And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?
Ses04F_impro04_M020 and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,
Ses04F_impro04_M021 you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.
Ses04F_impro04_M022 or some- some large percent of- of success.
Ses04F_impro04_M023 Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-
Ses04F_impro04_M026 Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-
Ses04F_impro04_M028 Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-
Ses04F_impro04_M030 I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-
Ses04F_impro04_M031 I'm trying to be helpful.
Ses04F_impro04_M033 I'm trying to watch TV.
Ses04F_impro05_F004 Lost it just, like, I mean,
Ses04F_impro05_F005 it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention
Ses04F_impro05_F006 because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.
Ses04F_impro05_F008 No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.
Ses04F_impro05_F009 You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.
Ses04F_impro05_F010 Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.
Ses04F_impro05_F011 Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.
Ses04F_impro05_F012 I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.
Ses04F_impro05_F013 I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-
Ses04F_impro05_F014 You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.
Ses04F_impro05_F015 No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.
Ses04F_impro05_F016 I want to talk to your supervisor.
Ses04F_impro05_F017 I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.
Ses04F_impro05_F018 Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?
Ses04F_impro05_F019 Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.
Ses04F_impro06_F000 Thanks.
Ses04F_impro06_F001 You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.
Ses04F_impro06_F002 I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?
Ses04F_impro06_F003 Yeah. I know. I know.
Ses04F_impro06_F004 Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-
Ses04F_impro06_F005 He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.
Ses04F_impro06_F006 It just doesn't seem fair.
Ses04F_impro06_F007 Thank you for being here.
Ses04F_impro06_F008 [LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.
Ses04F_impro06_F009 And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro06_F010 Yeah, I know.
Ses04F_impro06_M000 Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-
Ses04F_impro06_M001 When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.
Ses04F_impro06_M002 Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.
Ses04F_impro06_M003 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_M004 Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,
Ses04F_impro06_M005 you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like
Ses04F_impro06_M006 you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.
Ses04F_impro06_M007 It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.
Ses04F_impro06_M008 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_M009 It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.
Ses04F_impro06_M010 You're okay
Ses04F_impro06_M011 You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.
Ses04F_impro06_M012 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro06_M013 That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.
Ses04F_impro06_M014 So-
Ses04F_impro07_F000 Guess what came today?
Ses04F_impro07_F001 My acceptance letter.
Ses04F_impro07_F002 From U.S.C..
Ses04F_impro07_F003 Yes, I am.
Ses04F_impro07_F004 Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F005 Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C..
Ses04F_impro07_F006 I know. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F007 [LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No.
Ses04F_impro07_F008 [LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.
Ses04F_impro07_F009 The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.
Ses04F_impro07_F010 Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?
Ses04F_impro07_F011 There we go.  Perfect.
Ses04F_impro07_F012 And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.
Ses04F_impro07_F013 I don't want any of those little puny ones.
Ses04F_impro07_F014 Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.
Ses04F_impro07_F015 U.S.C. has a major in that, right.
Ses04F_impro07_F016 They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.
Ses04F_impro07_F017 Okay.  Well I'm lying but-
Ses04F_impro07_F018 Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out.
Ses04F_impro07_F021 okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F022 And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.
Ses04F_impro07_F024 So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-
Ses04F_impro07_F027 Everything worked out perfectly.
Ses04F_impro07_F028 I know.  We should have a party.
Ses04F_impro07_F029 An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.
Ses04F_impro07_F030 No.  An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F031 Right.  Now you're with me.
Ses04F_impro07_F032 That is why I got accepted.
Ses04F_impro07_F033 I know.
Ses04F_impro07_F035 What- what did you have in mind?
Ses04F_impro07_F036 [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F038 On occasion I've heard of it.
Ses04F_impro07_F039 Yeah.  Totally.
Ses04F_impro07_F040 I am totally down with the ice cream.
Ses04F_impro07_F041 Eh, we can work that part out.
Ses04F_impro07_F042 Alright.
Ses04F_impro07_F044 party.
Ses04F_impro07_F047 I know.
Ses04F_impro07_F048 Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.
Ses04F_impro07_F049 Well no.  I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job
Ses04F_impro07_F050 while I'm in school.  It'll be good.
Ses04F_impro07_F051 Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.
Ses04F_impro07_F052 I know.  Right down the street.
Ses04F_impro07_F058 Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.
Ses04F_impro07_F059 Okay.  No, that's dorky.
Ses04F_impro07_F060 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro07_F061 Student counsel?
Ses04F_impro07_F062 No, it's dorky.
Ses04F_impro07_F063 Social life.  Hello.
Ses04F_impro07_F064 [LAUGHTER].
Ses04F_impro07_F065 [LAUGHTER].
Ses04F_impro07_F066 No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the
Ses04F_impro07_F070 What have you heard about the Greek system?
Ses04F_impro07_F074 Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.
Ses04F_impro07_F078 That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F079 me.
Ses04F_impro07_M000 Hey, what's up?
Ses04F_impro07_M001 What?
Ses04F_impro07_M005 That's awesome.  Congratulations.
Ses04F_impro07_M006 That's amazing.  Wow.
Ses04F_impro07_M009 I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-
Ses04F_impro07_M013 So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?
Ses04F_impro07_M016 they have that as a major?
Ses04F_impro07_M017 That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.
Ses04F_impro07_M018 Seriously, what's your major?
Ses04F_impro07_M019 So you're undecided?
Ses04F_impro07_M020 Hey, that's cool.
Ses04F_impro07_M021 No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.
Ses04F_impro07_M022 Uh, well-
Ses04F_impro07_M023 You- you- you'll find.
Ses04F_impro07_M026 You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.
Ses04F_impro07_M028 That's awesome.
Ses04F_impro07_M031 Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.
Ses04F_impro07_M032 A party celebrating your acceptance.
Ses04F_impro07_M033 That's cool.
Ses04F_impro07_M034 Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm
Ses04F_impro07_M035 I don't know are you, like, I don't know.  Are you, like, available or anything?
Ses04F_impro07_M036 Well I mean I don't know.  It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like
Ses04F_impro07_M037 I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is.
Ses04F_impro07_M038 Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and
Ses04F_impro07_M039 actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on
Ses04F_impro07_M040 Vermont.
Ses04F_impro07_M041 Wait, you've been there before?
Ses04F_impro07_M042 Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome.
Ses04F_impro07_M043 Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.
Ses04F_impro07_M044 Okay.  Putt-putt golfing?
Ses04F_impro07_M045 Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go.
Ses04F_impro07_M046 I can see it in your eyes.  You want to go.
Ses04F_impro07_M049 Good. Alright we're so happy.
Ses04F_impro07_M050 That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school.
Ses04F_impro07_M051 Are you going to take out loans or-
Ses04F_impro07_M057 But, um-
Ses04F_impro07_M058 I mean, like, I don't know.  I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash.  You can, you know
Ses04F_impro07_M059 Or library.
Ses04F_impro07_M060 I just said the library
Ses04F_impro07_M061 or, um, campus cruiser.  You can drive people around.
Ses04F_impro07_M062 Right or you can run for student counsel.
Ses04F_impro07_M063 Dorky?
Ses04F_impro07_M064 It's important.
Ses04F_impro07_M066 Fine.  It's dorky.
Ses04F_impro07_M067 But that'll fit you  because you're a dork.
Ses04F_impro07_M070 I dork.
Ses04F_impro07_M071 Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by
Ses04F_impro07_M072 lots of drunk frat boys
Ses04F_impro07_M073 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro07_M076 I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.
Ses04F_impro07_M077 Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?
Ses04F_impro07_M079 I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-
Ses04F_impro07_M080 No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus
Ses04F_impro07_M082 that happened, you know, that was going on.
Ses04F_impro08_F000 Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?
Ses04F_impro08_F001 Okay.  Well, Did you go through the automated menu?  Most of your requests can be taken care of through that.
Ses04F_impro08_F002 Okay.  Well I'd be happy to-
Ses04F_impro08_F004 Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there.
Ses04F_impro08_F005 Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?
Ses04F_impro08_F006 Can you be a little more specific, sir?
Ses04F_impro08_F008 Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?
Ses04F_impro08_F009 Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address.
Ses04F_impro08_F023 But I'm giving you what you want.
Ses04F_impro08_M001 Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food
Ses04F_impro08_M012 It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.
Ses04F_impro08_M013 Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.
Ses04F_impro08_M014 Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now
Ses04F_impro08_M015 and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.
Ses04F_impro08_M016 You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.
Ses04F_impro08_M017 You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.
Ses04F_impro08_M018 You're going to fill out a form on your desk
Ses04F_impro08_M019 because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.
Ses04F_impro08_M022 Cindy?  Cindy what?
Ses04F_impro08_M023 Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check
Ses04F_impro08_M024 attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.
Ses04F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses04F_script01_1_F011 What do you want to do, argue with him?
Ses04F_script01_1_F012 You can't say that to him.
Ses04F_script01_1_F013 How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses04F_script01_1_F014 To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?
Ses04F_script01_1_F015 The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.
Ses04F_script01_1_F018 Well that's only your business, Chris.
Ses04F_script01_1_F019 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses04F_script01_1_F022 I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses04F_script01_1_F023 From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.
Ses04F_script01_1_F024 Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?
Ses04F_script01_1_F025 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
Ses04F_script01_1_F029 I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses04F_script01_1_F030 Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
Ses04F_script01_1_F032 You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?
Ses04F_script01_1_F035 Are you crazy?
Ses04F_script01_1_F036 You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses04F_script01_1_F037 Must you be inspired?
Ses04F_script01_1_F040 Alright but don't think that way
Ses04F_script01_1_F041 because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.
Ses04F_script01_1_F042 But don't think that way.  You hear me?
Ses04F_script01_1_F044 Yeah.  I can see that.
Ses04F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses04F_script01_1_M004 No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.
Ses04F_script01_1_M005 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
Ses04F_script01_1_M009 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses04F_script01_1_M010 I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.
Ses04F_script01_1_M012 We've got to say it to him.
Ses04F_script01_1_M013 For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses04F_script01_1_M016 You know why.
Ses04F_script01_1_M017 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses04F_script01_1_M020 Then it isn't just my business.
Ses04F_script01_1_M021 Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.
Ses04F_script01_1_M022 Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.
Ses04F_script01_1_M025 To hell with that.
Ses04F_script01_1_M026 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses04F_script01_1_M028 and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.
Ses04F_script01_1_M029 So what I'm not fast with women.
Ses04F_script01_1_M030 Because it is.
Ses04F_script01_1_M032 These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?
Ses04F_script01_1_M034 I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry
Ses04F_script01_1_M038 The business, the business doesn't inspire me.
Ses04F_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her?
Ses04F_script01_2_F001 It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses04F_script01_2_F005 What's going on here, Joe?
Ses04F_script01_2_F006 No, line.
Ses04F_script01_2_F007 She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.
Ses04F_script01_2_F008 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?
Ses04F_script01_2_F009 Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.
Ses04F_script01_2_F010 Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.
Ses04F_script01_2_F016 She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-
Ses04F_script01_2_M000 Why does that bother you?
Ses04F_script01_2_M001 Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses04F_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses04F_script01_2_M007 Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe
Ses04F_script01_2_M008 You can't read her mind.
Ses04F_script01_2_M017 What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.
Ses04F_script01_3_F009 I guess this is why I came.
Ses04F_script01_3_F010 Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.
Ses04F_script01_3_F012 You started to write me.
Ses04F_script01_3_F013 Every day since.
Ses04F_script01_3_F014 I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.
Ses04F_script01_3_F015 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses04F_script01_3_F023 Yeah, sure.
Ses04F_script01_3_F024 How many?
Ses04F_script01_3_F030 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses04F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses04F_script01_3_M008 I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.
Ses04F_script01_3_M009 Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M010 I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M011 I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I
Ses04F_script01_3_M014 And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
Ses04F_script01_3_M018 Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M019 I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M020 Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses04F_script01_3_M023 No, nothing like that.
Ses04F_script01_3_M024 Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.
Ses04F_script01_3_M026 There's so many things mixed up.
Ses04F_script01_3_M027 You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses04F_script01_3_M028 Well I lost them.
Ses04F_script01_3_M029 Just about all.
Ses04F_script01_3_M030 It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
Ses04F_script01_3_M031 For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.
Ses04F_script01_3_M032 I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.
Ses04F_script01_3_M033 They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
Ses04F_script01_3_M034 And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made
Ses04F_script01_3_M035 a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?
Ses04F_script01_3_M036 And then I came home and it was amazing.
Ses04F_script01_3_M039 I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
Ses04F_script01_3_M040 because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.
Ses04F_script01_3_M041 I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.
Ses04F_script01_3_M043 when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.
Ses04F_script01_3_M044 Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.
Ses04F_script01_3_M045 I guess that included you.
Ses04F_script01_3_M047 Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses04F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses04F_script02_1_F007 It's after eleven let's go home.
Ses04F_script02_1_F008 There is no point in coming down here.
Ses04F_script02_1_F012 I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses04F_script02_1_F013 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.
Ses04F_script02_1_F014 What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
Ses04F_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses04F_script02_1_F017 Yes.
Ses04F_script02_1_F019 We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses04F_script02_1_F021 About what?
Ses04F_script02_1_F022 It's ridiculous.
Ses04F_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
Ses04F_script02_1_M002 Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell
Ses04F_script02_1_M009 I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
Ses04F_script02_1_M010 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
Ses04F_script02_1_M011 Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses04F_script02_1_M017 That's my point too.
Ses04F_script02_1_M021 Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses04F_script02_1_M023 This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
Ses04F_script02_1_M026 like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic
Ses04F_script02_1_M031 We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.
Ses04F_script02_1_M032 I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.
Ses04F_script02_1_M033 Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
Ses04F_script02_1_M034 Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.
Ses04F_script02_1_M035 No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
Ses04F_script02_1_M036 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses04F_script02_1_M037 It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
Ses04F_script02_1_M038 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
Ses04F_script02_1_M039 where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses04F_script02_1_M040 Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
Ses04F_script02_2_F002 It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
Ses04F_script02_2_F005 Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses04F_script02_2_F006 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses04F_script02_2_F007 For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.
Ses04F_script02_2_F008 We totally skipped. Right.
Ses04F_script02_2_F009 For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.
Ses04F_script02_2_F010 We never do.  Do we have we ever?
Ses04F_script02_2_F011 Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.
Ses04F_script02_2_F014 and the fish won't show up.
Ses04F_script02_2_F019 We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes
Ses04F_script02_2_F020 and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me
Ses04F_script02_2_F021 right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses04F_script02_2_F022 And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses04F_script02_2_F023 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses04F_script02_2_F024 I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses04F_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses04F_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses04F_script02_2_F031 No.
Ses04F_script02_2_F033 This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses04F_script02_2_F034 Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses04F_script02_2_F037 I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses04F_script02_2_F041 somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses04F_script02_2_F043 Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.
Ses04F_script02_2_F044 Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.
Ses04F_script02_2_F045 Well then I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses04F_script02_2_F046 I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.
Ses04F_script02_2_M000 Well, so what do you think?
Ses04F_script02_2_M019 Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses04F_script02_2_M020 It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?
Ses04F_script02_2_M021 That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.
Ses04F_script02_2_M023 You want me to get some champagne?
Ses04F_script02_2_M040 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
Ses04F_script02_2_M041 No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses04F_script02_2_M043 Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
Ses04F_script02_2_M044 I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.
Ses04F_script02_2_M046 Well look at what we got here.
Ses04F_script02_2_M047 It's not champagne.
Ses04F_script03_1_F005 Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.
Ses04F_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses04F_script03_1_F007 Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
Ses04F_script03_1_F009 It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
Ses04F_script03_1_F011 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses04F_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses04F_script03_1_F014 Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?
Ses04F_script03_1_F017 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses04F_script03_1_F021 Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
Ses04F_script03_1_F022 Which particular one?
Ses04F_script03_1_F023 Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses04F_script03_1_F024 Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses04F_script03_1_F026 It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses04F_script03_1_F028 Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses04F_script03_1_F029 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04F_script03_1_F030 And very much sillier.
Ses04F_script03_1_M006 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses04F_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise.
Ses04F_script03_1_M008 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses04F_script03_1_M009 Don't say that, my darling.
Ses04F_script03_1_M017 Well who knows?
Ses04F_script03_1_M027 Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
Ses04F_script03_1_M028 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
Ses04F_script03_1_M029 Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses04F_script03_1_M030 How long did that row last?
Ses04F_script03_1_M031 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
Ses04F_script03_2_F005 What of it?
Ses04F_script03_2_F012 It's become a habit with you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F013 Oh, don't be so stupid.
Ses04F_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses04F_script03_2_F019 It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F020 Adders don't snap they sting.
Ses04F_script03_2_F021 They sting.
Ses04F_script03_2_F022 I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
Ses04F_script03_2_F023 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses04F_script03_2_F024 Mind your own business.
Ses04F_script03_2_F025 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses04F_script03_2_F026 You always had a weak head.
Ses04F_script03_2_F027 On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses04F_script03_2_F028 Oh, shut up.
Ses04F_script03_2_F029 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
Ses04F_script03_2_F030 Why?
Ses04F_script03_2_F031 There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses04F_script03_2_F034 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses04F_script03_2_F035 You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses04F_script03_2_F036 Go away, go away.  I hate you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F037 Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.
Ses04F_script03_2_F038 Stop.
Ses04F_script03_2_F039 Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses04F_script03_2_F040 This is the end do you understand?  The end,
Ses04F_script03_2_F041 finally and forever
Ses04F_script03_2_F042 Oh, I am.  Let go of me.
Ses04F_script03_2_F043 Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.
Ses04F_script03_2_F044 I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.
Ses04F_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses04F_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses04F_script03_2_M003 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses04F_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses04F_script03_2_M006 What of it?
Ses04F_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses04F_script03_2_M008 That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses04F_script03_2_M010 I'll have some myself, I think.
Ses04F_script03_2_M014 Really, Amanda.
Ses04F_script03_2_M015 Nothing.
Ses04F_script03_2_M016 Going somewhere, my dear?
Ses04F_script03_2_M024 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses04F_script03_2_M027 I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses04F_script03_2_M031 Very good idea.  I will.
Ses04F_script03_2_M034 There are people downstairs I suppose.
Ses04F_script03_2_M035 This is no time of year for Tunis.
Ses04F_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses04F_script03_2_M039 Amanda, listen.
Ses04F_script03_2_M040 Very amusing.
Ses04F_script03_2_M041 You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses04F_script03_2_M042 You're not going like this.
Ses04F_script03_2_M043 You're not.
Ses04F_script03_2_M044 Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.
Ses04F_script03_2_M045 You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.
Ses04M_impro01_F000 Okay.  What's the problem?
Ses04M_impro01_F001 Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?
Ses04M_impro01_F002 Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro01_F012 twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.
Ses04M_impro01_F018 So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.
Ses04M_impro01_F019 Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?
Ses04M_impro01_F021 Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.
Ses04M_impro01_M000 Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.
Ses04M_impro01_M003 Yes, I do.
Ses04M_impro01_M018 It's not rocket science.
Ses04M_impro01_M024 Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.
Ses04M_impro02_F009 You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?
Ses04M_impro02_F020 When do you leave?
Ses04M_impro02_F021 A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.
Ses04M_impro02_M000 It's only going to be a year.
Ses04M_impro02_M008 There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.
Ses04M_impro03_F002 I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?
Ses04M_impro03_F003 [LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.
Ses04M_impro03_F004 Did she cry?
Ses04M_impro03_F005 Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?
Ses04M_impro03_F006 I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!
Ses04M_impro03_F007 Yeah, it is.
Ses04M_impro03_F008 Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_F009 Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--
Ses04M_impro03_F010 Oh, my God.
Ses04M_impro03_F011 Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.
Ses04M_impro03_F012 Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.
Ses04M_impro03_F015 It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?
Ses04M_impro03_F016 Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_F017 I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-
Ses04M_impro03_F019 It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.
Ses04M_impro03_F024 This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_F025 All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_M002 Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?
Ses04M_impro03_M005 Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.
Ses04M_impro03_M006 She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...
Ses04M_impro03_M007 Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months.
Ses04M_impro03_M008 Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.
Ses04M_impro03_M009 But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of
Ses04M_impro03_M011 Okay. Well there you go.
Ses04M_impro03_M015 Barefoot?
Ses04M_impro03_M017 Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--
Ses04M_impro03_M019 It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--
Ses04M_impro03_M020 Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-
Ses04M_impro03_M021 Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-
Ses04M_impro03_M022 Yeah, yeah.
Ses04M_impro03_M023 Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.
Ses04M_impro03_M024 But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it.
Ses04M_impro03_M025 And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues.
Ses04M_impro03_M026 She's okay with it.
Ses04M_impro03_M028 Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.
Ses04M_impro03_M029 All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.
Ses04M_impro03_M030 Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.
Ses04M_impro03_M031 So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--
Ses04M_impro04_F000 Well there has to be something you haven't tried.
Ses04M_impro04_F001 What about like a temp agency?
Ses04M_impro04_F002 Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.
Ses04M_impro04_F003 Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and
Ses04M_impro04_F004 I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.
Ses04M_impro04_F005 Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.
Ses04M_impro04_F006 Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.
Ses04M_impro04_F007 If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.
Ses04M_impro04_F008 Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.
Ses04M_impro04_F009 I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--
Ses04M_impro04_F011 It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?
Ses04M_impro04_F012 Well that sounds like your fault.
Ses04M_impro04_F013 You didn't do what I told you to do.
Ses04M_impro04_F015 I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.
Ses04M_impro04_F016 Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?
Ses04M_impro04_F017 [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro04_M004 there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.
Ses04M_impro04_M020 Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?
Ses04M_impro04_M021 That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.
Ses04M_impro04_M022 Yours.  I don't--
Ses04M_impro05_F000 Hi, how can I help you?
Ses04M_impro05_F001 Mmhmm.
Ses04M_impro05_F002 I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro05_F003 Right.
Ses04M_impro05_F006 Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.
Ses04M_impro05_F007 Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar
Ses04M_impro05_F008 refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes
Ses04M_impro05_F009 That's our policy, sir.
Ses04M_impro05_F010 I can't do that.
Ses04M_impro05_F013 We'll cover fifty.
Ses04M_impro05_F017 I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.
Ses04M_impro05_F019 I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-
Ses04M_impro05_F020 But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.
Ses04M_impro05_F036 I understand you're frustrated, but--
Ses04M_impro05_F037 I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.
Ses04M_impro05_M008 fifty dollars?
Ses04M_impro05_M009 fifty dollars. No way, no.
Ses04M_impro05_M010 I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.
Ses04M_impro05_M011 You understand?
Ses04M_impro05_M014 No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--
Ses04M_impro05_M015 You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.
Ses04M_impro05_M016 You--
Ses04M_impro05_M017 No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.
Ses04M_impro05_M018 Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.
Ses04M_impro05_M022 Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--
Ses04M_impro05_M026 but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.
Ses04M_impro05_M038 Please.
Ses04M_impro05_M039 I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.
Ses04M_impro05_M044 Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.
Ses04M_impro05_M045 So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?
Ses04M_impro06_F000 Hey, how you doing?
Ses04M_impro06_F001 I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro06_F002 I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--
Ses04M_impro06_F003 I'm sorry.  It's never easy.
Ses04M_impro06_F004 But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --
Ses04M_impro06_F005 --it doesn't really do anything.  But--
Ses04M_impro06_F006 I know.  It never is.
Ses04M_impro06_F007 How's, um -- how's his parents doing?
Ses04M_impro06_F008 I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-
Ses04M_impro06_F009 Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.
Ses04M_impro06_F010 I mean, we can be grateful for that.
Ses04M_impro06_F011 You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.
Ses04M_impro06_F012 It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.
Ses04M_impro06_F014 I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.
Ses04M_impro06_F015 When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--
Ses04M_impro06_F016 Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.
Ses04M_impro06_F017 I know.
Ses04M_impro06_F018 I don't have any magic answers.  But,
Ses04M_impro06_F019 I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.
Ses04M_impro06_M000 Thanks.
Ses04M_impro06_M001 I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,
Ses04M_impro06_M002 a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.
Ses04M_impro06_M003 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_M004 Thanks.
Ses04M_impro06_M005 I just -- it's just not fair.
Ses04M_impro06_M006 I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they
Ses04M_impro06_M007 feel the same way everybody else does.
Ses04M_impro06_M008 [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.
Ses04M_impro06_M009 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_M010 Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--
Ses04M_impro06_M011 This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.
Ses04M_impro06_M012 I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -
Ses04M_impro06_M013 there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.
Ses04M_impro06_M014 I don't know what to do.
Ses04M_impro06_M015 I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.
Ses04M_impro06_M016 I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.
Ses04M_impro06_M017 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro06_M018 I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.
Ses04M_impro06_M019 Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.
Ses04M_impro06_M020 I know.
Ses04M_impro07_F002 I didn't even
Ses04M_impro07_F003 know you applied to U.S.C..
Ses04M_impro07_F004 That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?
Ses04M_impro07_F006 Right.
Ses04M_impro07_F007 Yes.
Ses04M_impro07_F008 Is U.S.C. known for its history program?
Ses04M_impro07_F009 I know.  It's a great school and you know
Ses04M_impro07_F010 It's all about the connections
Ses04M_impro07_F011 Oh, you did not just say that.
Ses04M_impro07_F012 I know.  You're going to be so close.
Ses04M_impro07_F013 I'm glad you did.
Ses04M_impro07_F014 That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here.
Ses04M_impro07_F015 Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.
Ses04M_impro07_F016 Give or take. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro07_F017 Well congratulations.
Ses04M_impro07_F018 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_F022 But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing.
Ses04M_impro07_F023 The -- what, the- I mean--
Ses04M_impro07_F026 Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--
Ses04M_impro07_F027 Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro07_F036 Excuse me?
Ses04M_impro07_F037 No.
Ses04M_impro07_M000 Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..
Ses04M_impro07_M001 I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_M002 Yeah, yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_M003 I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but
Ses04M_impro07_M004 it's a really good school.  So
Ses04M_impro07_M007 Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.
Ses04M_impro07_M008 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_M009 And, uh-
Ses04M_impro07_M010 Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school
Ses04M_impro07_M011 and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-
Ses04M_impro07_M012 I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program.
Ses04M_impro07_M013 So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro07_M014 Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school
Ses04M_impro07_M015 And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome
Ses04M_impro07_M020 umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses
Ses04M_impro07_M021 find out all this stuff.  And- and I don't know.  I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm.
Ses04M_impro07_M025 Ouch.  That's, um -- oh, wow.
Ses04M_impro07_M026 No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --
Ses04M_impro07_M029 I'll go to basketball games.
Ses04M_impro07_M030 Maybe some golf matches.
Ses04M_impro07_M032 I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.
Ses04M_impro07_M035 No, I'm not going to go to a football game.
Ses04M_impro07_M036 Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.
Ses04M_impro07_M037 I do -- I will need to get a gun-
Ses04M_impro07_M040 Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean
Ses04M_impro07_M041 I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife
Ses04M_impro07_M042 'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus
Ses04M_impro07_M043 Well I need to defend myself from
Ses04M_impro08_F020 You're just going to put it back on my account.
Ses04M_impro08_F022 Oh, my God, thank you so much.

Ses04M_impro08_M004 Okay.
Ses04M_impro08_M005 Umm, Miss Aruckman
Ses04M_impro08_M006 I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.
Ses04M_impro08_M008 So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.
Ses04M_impro08_M010 All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.
Ses04M_impro08_M011 What I can
Ses04M_impro08_M012 What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form
Ses04M_impro08_M013 which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.

Ses04M_impro08_M019 Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.
Ses04M_impro08_M020 I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.
Ses04M_impro08_M021 Sure.
Ses04M_impro08_M022 You're welcome.
Ses04M_impro08_M023 No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um
Ses04M_impro08_M024 You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um
Ses04M_impro08_M025 Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.
Ses04M_impro08_M026 God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever
Ses04M_impro08_M027 if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.
Ses04M_impro08_M028 Alright. Take Care.
Ses04M_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
Ses04M_script01_1_F007 He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?
Ses04M_script01_1_F011 You can't say that to him.
Ses04M_script01_1_F012 How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses04M_script01_1_F013 To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?
Ses04M_script01_1_F015 Why?
Ses04M_script01_1_F017 Well that's only your business, Chris.
Ses04M_script01_1_F018 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses04M_script01_1_F019 Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --
Ses04M_script01_1_F021 I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses04M_script01_1_F022 From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.
Ses04M_script01_1_F027 How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
Ses04M_script01_1_F028 The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses04M_script01_1_F029 I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses04M_script01_1_F032 Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?
Ses04M_script01_1_F033 Just give it some more thought.
Ses04M_script01_1_F034 What the hell is this?
Ses04M_script01_1_F035 Are you crazy?
Ses04M_script01_1_F036 You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses04M_script01_1_F037 Must you be inspired?
Ses04M_script01_1_F039 You don't want to think like that.
Ses04M_script01_1_F040 Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.
Ses04M_script01_1_F041 But don't think that way, you hear me?
Ses04M_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses04M_script01_1_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses04M_script01_1_M013 We've gotta say it to him.
Ses04M_script01_1_M014 For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
Ses04M_script01_1_M018 Going to ask her to marry me.
Ses04M_script01_1_M021 Well, then you know it's not only my business.
Ses04M_script01_1_M022 Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses04M_script01_1_M026 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses04M_script01_1_M031 Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.
Ses04M_script01_1_M032 Yeah, let's keep going.
Ses04M_script01_1_M034 father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.
Ses04M_script01_1_M037 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses04M_script01_1_M038 Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.
Ses04M_script01_1_M040 Yes, on this I would.
Ses04M_script01_1_M041 Then you help me stay here.
Ses04M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses04M_script01_2_F001 Why does that bother you?
Ses04M_script01_2_F002 She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--
Ses04M_script01_2_F003 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses04M_script01_2_F004 He's not going to marry her.
Ses04M_script01_2_F005 It's got that about it.
Ses04M_script01_2_F006 What's going on here, Joe?
Ses04M_script01_2_F007 Now listen, kid. Now, listen.
Ses04M_script01_2_F008 She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.
Ses04M_script01_2_F009 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.
Ses04M_script01_2_F010 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.
Ses04M_script01_2_F011 Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses04M_script01_2_F012 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses04M_script01_2_F013 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.
Ses04M_script01_2_F014 Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?
Ses04M_script01_2_F015 She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--
Ses04M_script01_2_F016 Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone
Ses04M_script01_2_F018 You, above all, have got to believe.  You.
Ses04M_script01_2_F020 I can't help it.
Ses04M_script01_2_M000 Oh, God, line.
Ses04M_script01_2_M005 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses04M_script01_2_M006 Well so what?
Ses04M_script01_2_M007 Line.
Ses04M_script01_2_M019 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses04M_script01_3_F012 Every day since.
Ses04M_script01_3_F013 I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.
Ses04M_script01_3_F014 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses04M_script01_3_F022 How many?
Ses04M_script01_3_F023 Oh, gees.
Ses04M_script01_3_F027 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses04M_script01_3_M022 Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.
Ses04M_script01_3_M023 I don't know where to start.
Ses04M_script01_3_M024 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
Ses04M_script01_3_M025 Well I lost them.
Ses04M_script01_3_M026 Just about all.
Ses04M_script01_3_M027 It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
Ses04M_script01_3_M028 For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses04M_script01_3_M030 And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,
Ses04M_script01_3_M031 a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.
Ses04M_script01_3_M032 There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
Ses04M_script01_3_M033 because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;
Ses04M_script01_3_M034 to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.
Ses04M_script01_3_M035 You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.
Ses04M_script01_3_M037 Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.
Ses04M_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses04M_script02_1_F002 It's not yours.
Ses04M_script02_1_F003 It's ours.  It's mine, too.
Ses04M_script02_1_F004 You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?
Ses04M_script02_1_F005 Yes.
Ses04M_script02_1_F007 It's after eleven; let's go home.
Ses04M_script02_1_F008 There is no point in coming down here.
Ses04M_script02_1_F010 So let's go home.
Ses04M_script02_1_F012 I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses04M_script02_1_F013 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.
Ses04M_script02_1_F014 What are you so excited about?
Ses04M_script02_1_F017 Yes.
Ses04M_script02_1_F018 Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.
Ses04M_script02_1_M001 Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?
Ses04M_script02_1_M002 Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?
Ses04M_script02_1_M003 How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.
Ses04M_script02_1_M005 Whose is it?
Ses04M_script02_1_M008 I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
Ses04M_script02_1_M009 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.
Ses04M_script02_1_M012 You want my jacket?
Ses04M_script02_1_M014 Right.
Ses04M_script02_1_M015 That's my point, too.
Ses04M_script02_1_M018 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
Ses04M_script02_1_M020 There's mystery here and magic.
Ses04M_script02_1_M021 Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.
Ses04M_script02_1_M022 Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.
Ses04M_script02_1_M023 There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
Ses04M_script02_1_M028 no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
Ses04M_script02_1_M029 Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;
Ses04M_script02_1_M030 just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
Ses04M_script02_1_M031 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
Ses04M_script02_1_M032 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.
Ses04M_script02_1_M033 Well so what did you think?
Ses04M_script02_2_F000 Look at this, goose bumps.
Ses04M_script02_2_F006 Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses04M_script02_2_F007 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses04M_script02_2_F009 We never do, do we?  Have we ever?
Ses04M_script02_2_F013 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.
Ses04M_script02_2_F016 It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses04M_script02_2_F018 Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses04M_script02_2_F019 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses04M_script02_2_F020 No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F021 No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F026 I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
Ses04M_script02_2_F027 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses04M_script02_2_F028 Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses04M_script02_2_F029 But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses04M_script02_2_F032 I didn't say that.
Ses04M_script02_2_F035 Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.
Ses04M_script02_2_F036 Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.
Ses04M_script02_2_M000 Well so what'd you think?
Ses04M_script02_2_M001 What I said.
Ses04M_script02_2_M006 Well what's bugging you?
Ses04M_script02_2_M007 There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.
Ses04M_script02_2_M020 Wait a minute, I've got it.
Ses04M_script02_2_M021 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.
Ses04M_script02_2_M029 Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.
Ses04M_script02_2_M031 And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
Ses04M_script02_2_M034 No, I know, me neither.
Ses04M_script02_2_M037 No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses04M_script02_2_M039 Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
Ses04M_script02_2_M040 I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.
Ses04M_script02_2_M041 Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses04M_script03_1_F005 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
Ses04M_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses04M_script03_1_F007 Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.
Ses04M_script03_1_F008 But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses04M_script03_1_F009 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses04M_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses04M_script03_1_F013 If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.
Ses04M_script03_1_F014 How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?
Ses04M_script03_1_F015 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses04M_script03_1_F017 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?
Ses04M_script03_1_F018 Well that's serious enough, isn't it?
Ses04M_script03_1_F021 Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.
Ses04M_script03_1_F022 Which particular one?
Ses04M_script03_1_F023 Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses04M_script03_1_F024 I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses04M_script03_1_F025 It went on intermittently for days.
Ses04M_script03_1_F026 It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses04M_script03_1_F027 That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses04M_script03_1_F028 The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
Ses04M_script03_1_F029 How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04M_script03_1_F030 And very much sillier.
Ses04M_script03_1_M003 We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?
Ses04M_script03_1_M004 I don't care, then.
Ses04M_script03_1_M006 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
Ses04M_script03_1_M007 With the mo- with the most perfect poise?
Ses04M_script03_1_M010 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
Ses04M_script03_1_M012 You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.
Ses04M_script03_1_M013 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.
Ses04M_script03_1_M016 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses04M_script03_1_M021 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses04M_script03_1_M025 Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses04M_script03_1_M028 Line?
Ses04M_script03_1_M029 How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?
Ses04M_script03_1_M033 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses04M_script03_2_F000 That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses04M_script03_2_F001 The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
Ses04M_script03_2_F002 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04M_script03_2_F003 And very much sillier.
Ses04M_script03_2_F006 Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses04M_script03_2_F008 Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.
Ses04M_script03_2_F009 Let him kiss you.
Ses04M_script03_2_F010 What of it?
Ses04M_script03_2_F014 No, thanks.
Ses04M_script03_2_F017 It's become a habit with you.
Ses04M_script03_2_F019 What?
Ses04M_script03_2_F022 Oh, no, it isn't.
Ses04M_script03_2_F023 Oh, be quiet.
Ses04M_script03_2_F024 It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_F026 Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses04M_script03_2_F028 I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
Ses04M_script03_2_F029 Yes, I did, quite a lot.
Ses04M_script03_2_F030 Mind your own business.
Ses04M_script03_2_F031 You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.
Ses04M_script03_2_F032 You always had a weak head.
Ses04M_script03_2_F033 On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_F034 Oh, shut up.
Ses04M_script03_2_F035 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_F036 Why?
Ses04M_script03_2_F037 There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses04M_script03_2_F039 Turn it on again, please.
Ses04M_script03_2_F040 Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses04M_script03_2_F041 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses04M_script03_2_F042 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses04M_script03_2_F043 We swapped. Listen.
Ses04M_script03_2_F044 Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.
Ses04M_script03_2_F045 Stop.
Ses04M_script03_2_F046 Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses04M_script03_2_F047 This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.
Ses04M_script03_2_F048 Oh, yes, I am.
Ses04M_script03_2_F049 Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.
Ses04M_script03_2_F050 Marry you again? Huh.
Ses04M_script03_2_F051 Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.
Ses04M_script03_2_F052 Swine.
Ses04M_script03_2_M001 I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses04M_script03_2_M008 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?
Ses04M_script03_2_M009 Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_M010 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses04M_script03_2_M011 What of it?
Ses04M_script03_2_M012 What about me?
Ses04M_script03_2_M013 That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses04M_script03_2_M014 So am I; bored stiff.
Ses04M_script03_2_M020 Really, Amanda
Ses04M_script03_2_M021 Nothing.
Ses04M_script03_2_M022 Going out somewhere, my dear?
Ses04M_script03_2_M024 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
Ses04M_script03_2_M025 Yes, it is.
Ses04M_script03_2_M026 Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_M027 It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses04M_script03_2_M028 Line?
Ses04M_script03_2_M029 Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.
Ses04M_script03_2_M030 They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
Ses04M_script03_2_M031 They snap.
Ses04M_script03_2_M033 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?
Ses04M_script03_2_M034 You must have had a riotous time.
Ses04M_script03_2_M035 No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.
Ses04M_script03_2_M036 I'm not in the least drunk.
Ses04M_script03_2_M038 Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?
Ses04M_script03_2_M040 Very good idea.  I will
Ses04M_script03_2_M041 You better turn that off I think.
Ses04M_script03_2_M043 There are people downstairs, I suppose
Ses04M_script03_2_M046 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses04M_script03_2_M047 Turn it off.

Ses04M_script03_2_M049 You're a vile tempered, loosed living
Ses04M_script03_2_M050 wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.
Ses04M_script03_2_M051 You're not going like this.

Ses04M_script03_2_M053 Shut up. Shut up.
Ses04M_script03_2_M054 You're a mean, evil minded
Ses04M_script03_2_M055 little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.
Ses04M_script03_2_M056 Whore.
Ses05F_impro01_F000 Hi, I need an ID.
Ses05F_impro01_F008 So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-
Ses05F_impro01_F017 Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.
Ses05F_impro01_F018 Why not?
Ses05F_impro01_F020 Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.
Ses05F_impro01_M000 ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from.
Ses05F_impro01_M003 Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.
Ses05F_impro02_F001 um.
Ses05F_impro02_F002 I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call--
Ses05F_impro02_F004 I got a call today,
Ses05F_impro02_F005 I'm going to need to go overseas for a while.
Ses05F_impro02_F008 I don't know "sigh".
Ses05F_impro02_F009 I know.  I know.
Ses05F_impro02_F010 I know.  Well, we'll have to figure all that out.  I mean, I think the Army's going to provide childcare and help us out with that. um.
Ses05F_impro02_F011 Iraq.
Ses05F_impro02_F012 I think infantry.  I'm not sure.
Ses05F_impro02_F021 I don't think there's anything we can do.
Ses05F_impro02_F023 I know.  I know it's not fair.
Ses05F_impro02_F024 Well, apparently nobody else can go.
Ses05F_impro02_F027 I know.
Ses05F_impro02_F028 I know.
Ses05F_impro02_F029 We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us?
Ses05F_impro02_F031 I'm going to miss their first words.
Ses05F_impro02_F032 You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.
Ses05F_impro02_F034 Yeah, as much as I can.
Ses05F_impro02_F035 "sigh" Three weeks.
Ses05F_impro02_F036 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro02_F037 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro02_F038 I love you.  I'm going to miss you so much. "sigh"
Ses05F_impro02_M000 What is it?
Ses05F_impro02_M004 You got called up.
Ses05F_impro02_M005 I thought you said this wasn't going to happen for at least a year.
Ses05F_impro02_M010 Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?
Ses05F_impro02_M014 I don't understand why they would just do something like this?
Ses05F_impro02_M015 It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.
Ses05F_impro02_M024 I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.
Ses05F_impro02_M025 It's not fair.
Ses05F_impro02_M026 Why has to be you?  There's all those other people.  Somebody else can go instead.  It's not right.
Ses05F_impro02_M029 I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.
Ses05F_impro02_M031 I jus-
Ses05F_impro02_M032 I don't know.
Ses05F_impro02_M033 Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say.
Ses05F_impro02_M034 Yeah, we'll call them.  We'll figure something out.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You're right.
Ses05F_impro02_M035 I know.

Ses05F_impro02_M041 I love you.
Ses05F_impro03_F000 Okay, so big news.
Ses05F_impro03_F001 I'm getting married.
Ses05F_impro03_F002 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F003 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F004 Uh-huh.
Ses05F_impro03_F005 Just a couple days ago.
Ses05F_impro03_F007 I know me neither.
Ses05F_impro03_F008 Right, I thought I would be way older too. I thought I would be I be at least thirty something.
Ses05F_impro03_F009 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F011 Sorry.
Ses05F_impro03_F020 Yeah.  Yeah, of course.
Ses05F_impro03_F027 It's so weird too, right, that like you can grow up so near somebody and never know them until you travel hundreds of miles away.
Ses05F_impro03_F028 I know
Ses05F_impro03_F029 Right, being like oh, where are you from?  The U.S.  Where in the U.S.?  Chicago.  Where in Chicago?
Ses05F_impro03_F030 Knowing the neighborhood.  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.

Ses05F_impro03_F041 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro03_F042 I know. I can't believe it.
Ses05F_impro03_F043 I am very excited
Ses05F_impro03_F046 I have to think about moving now.  We're going to move in together
Ses05F_impro03_F047 I think it's a good idea to live together before you get married.
Ses05F_impro03_F048 I don't want a house, I mean just-
Ses05F_impro03_F049 L.A. apartment is fine.
Ses05F_impro03_F051 Two artists, though.  We're bound to be poor forever.
Ses05F_impro03_F053 Definitely not for a while
Ses05F_impro03_F054 yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F055 [LAUGHTER] Good luck.
Ses05F_impro03_F056 You won't have trouble, You won't have trouble.

Ses05F_impro03_M006 Oh my gosh.
Ses05F_impro03_M007 And you actually said yes.  I can't believe it.  I never thought you would get married.
Ses05F_impro03_M008 Oh my gosh.
Ses05F_impro03_M009 Oh absolutely.
Ses05F_impro03_M010 Well, we always said we'd be in our thirtieth when we got married. And we were going to get married to each other if we didn't by then
Ses05F_impro03_M011 Thirty nine, yeah.  I can't believe it.  So you broke our pact. Thanks a lot.
Ses05F_impro03_M012 Thanks a lot.  Well, okay, you've got to tell me the details.  What did he say?  Where was it?  What happened?
Ses05F_impro03_M013 Okay.  That's okay, spontaneous is great.  Spontaneous is awesome.
Ses05F_impro03_M020 Am I in it?
Ses05F_impro03_M027 Cool, perfect.  Another Chicagoite, got to love it.
Ses05F_impro03_M030 [LAUGHTER] I am sil
Ses05F_impro03_M031 And now you're getting married.
Ses05F_impro03_M032 That is amazing.  You must be so excited.  Did you tell your mom?
Ses05F_impro03_M033 Oh, did she cry?
Ses05F_impro03_M035 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro03_M036 you.. I can't believe it.  I'm so happy for you.  This is exactly what you wanted.  It's your dream come true.
Ses05F_impro03_M037 The exact right guy, I fully approve.  He's a wonderful guy.  We have a great time.  He can drink.  That's awesome.
Ses05F_impro03_M038 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro03_M039 Of course, of course she will ... of course she will.  Yeah, don't go and disappear like everyone else after they get married and I never see them again.  That'll make me mad.  You don't want to make me mad.  You know how I get when I get mad.
Ses05F_impro03_M040 Exactly.
Ses05F_impro03_M041 Exactly, "laugh".
Ses05F_impro03_M043 Oh, thanks. move here before you get married [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro03_M044 Perfect, okay, good. "sigh"
Ses05F_impro03_M045 I don't feel so bad then.  Well, I'm excited for you.
Ses05F_impro03_M046 I can't believe it.
Ses05F_impro03_M049 So I was one of the first ones? That makes me feel so important.
Ses05F_impro03_M050 Oh yeah, of course.
Ses05F_impro03_M051 I think so, too.  Are you going to get a house or-
Ses05F_impro03_M057 yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_M058 yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_M060 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro03_M061 Oh, thanks.  I'll need it.
Ses05F_impro03_M062 Oh thanks, you're too nice
Ses05F_impro03_M063 just being polite now
Ses05F_impro03_M064 because I am not getting married.
Ses05F_impro03_M065 Exactly, [LAUGHTER] I think that'll go over great, don't you?
Ses05F_impro03_M066 That's what girls like, right?
Ses05F_impro03_M067 Would you mind popping out a few for me?
Ses05F_impro03_M068 That'd be great, thanks.
Ses05F_impro04_F000 Brian, I need help.
Ses05F_impro04_F008 I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.
Ses05F_impro04_F015 I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.
Ses05F_impro04_F016 Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?
Ses05F_impro04_F017 I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.
Ses05F_impro04_F019 I'm just worried.
Ses05F_impro04_F022 That's really hard to hear.
Ses05F_impro04_F023 I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.
Ses05F_impro04_F038 Well, I'd like to be a working actor.
Ses05F_impro04_F039 But um--
Ses05F_impro04_F040 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro04_F041 Bartending, catering.
Ses05F_impro04_F042 Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.
Ses05F_impro04_F043 yeah.
Ses05F_impro04_F044 Thank you.
Ses05F_impro04_F045 I will, I will.
Ses05F_impro04_M000 Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.
Ses05F_impro04_M001 Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?
Ses05F_impro04_M003 I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.
Ses05F_impro04_M004 Nothing's impossible.
Ses05F_impro04_M005 You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and
Ses05F_impro04_M007 No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.
Ses05F_impro04_M008 and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.
Ses05F_impro04_M009 Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.
Ses05F_impro04_M010 [GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--
Ses05F_impro04_M011 Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.
Ses05F_impro04_M012 Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?
Ses05F_impro04_M013 Have you?  There's got to be something else.
Ses05F_impro04_M015 If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.
Ses05F_impro04_M016 Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.
Ses05F_impro04_M017 Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.
Ses05F_impro04_M020 It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-
Ses05F_impro04_M022 Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.
Ses05F_impro04_M024 You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.
Ses05F_impro04_M025 You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.
Ses05F_impro04_M026 But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.
Ses05F_impro04_M027 And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?
Ses05F_impro04_M028 I mean are you going in for interviews?
Ses05F_impro04_M029 Are you presenting-
Ses05F_impro04_M030 putting your best foot forward? or you
Ses05F_impro04_M031 Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?
Ses05F_impro04_M032 Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?
Ses05F_impro04_M033 Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?
Ses05F_impro04_M034 Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?
Ses05F_impro04_M035 Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?
Ses05F_impro04_M036 Of course.
Ses05F_impro04_M037 Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.
Ses05F_impro04_M038 So what's the something else?
Ses05F_impro04_M039 You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.
Ses05F_impro04_M040 If I- If you- Will you stick with it?
Ses05F_impro04_M041 Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.
Ses05F_impro04_M042 But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?
Ses05F_impro04_M043 You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro05_F000 Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.
Ses05F_impro05_F001 Um-Seventeen. Coming from --
Ses05F_impro05_F002 It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.
Ses05F_impro05_F004 Right.
Ses05F_impro05_F005 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro05_F006 That's good.
Ses05F_impro05_F007 Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?
Ses05F_impro05_F010 Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.
Ses05F_impro05_F018 Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.
Ses05F_impro05_F019 No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?
Ses05F_impro05_F020 Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.
Ses05F_impro05_F021 Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.
Ses05F_impro05_F022 Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.
Ses05F_impro05_F023 And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.
Ses05F_impro05_F024 That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.
Ses05F_impro05_F031 I don't believe that for a second.
Ses05F_impro05_F033 What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?
Ses05F_impro05_F034 You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-
Ses05F_impro05_F041 No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.
Ses05F_impro05_F042 It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.
Ses05F_impro05_M000 Okay, what flight were you on?
Ses05F_impro05_M001 On what airline?
Ses05F_impro05_M002 From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?
Ses05F_impro05_M003 So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.
Ses05F_impro05_M004 Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-
Ses05F_impro05_M005 It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-
Ses05F_impro05_M006 But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh
Ses05F_impro05_M007 I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.
Ses05F_impro05_M008 Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.
Ses05F_impro05_M009 Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?
Ses05F_impro05_M010 Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?
Ses05F_impro05_M012 Are you sure?
Ses05F_impro05_M014 All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?
Ses05F_impro05_M015 Sentimental value.
Ses05F_impro05_M016 Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.
Ses05F_impro05_M017 No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.
Ses05F_impro05_M018 Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?
Ses05F_impro05_M019 Well,
Ses05F_impro05_M022 Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.
Ses05F_impro05_M023 Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?
Ses05F_impro05_M025 Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?
Ses05F_impro05_M030 Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?
Ses05F_impro05_M031 Well, my hands are really tied then.
Ses05F_impro05_M032 Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--
Ses05F_impro05_M033 Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?
Ses05F_impro05_M034 Uh, so it was really heavy.
Ses05F_impro05_M036 I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.
Ses05F_impro05_M037 Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.
Ses05F_impro05_M039 Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-
Ses05F_impro05_M040 makes up?
Ses05F_impro05_M041 The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.
Ses05F_impro05_M048 Right.
Ses05F_impro05_M050 And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.
Ses05F_impro05_M051 So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?
Ses05F_impro05_M052 Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.
Ses05F_impro05_M053 You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro06_F000 A good friend of mine passed away the other day.
Ses05F_impro06_F001 Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,
Ses05F_impro06_F002 metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-
Ses05F_impro06_F003 Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.
Ses05F_impro06_F004 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F005 Kind of.
Ses05F_impro06_F006 It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.
Ses05F_impro06_F007 I just, I don't know.
Ses05F_impro06_F008 I know.
Ses05F_impro06_F009 And he could of...  He was pretty awesome
Ses05F_impro06_F010 Uh,  We grew up together.
Ses05F_impro06_F011 Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.
Ses05F_impro06_F012 I feel really bad for his family, you know.
Ses05F_impro06_F013 It must be really, really hard to lose a child.
Ses05F_impro06_F014 Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-
Ses05F_impro06_F015 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F016 I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.
Ses05F_impro06_F017 Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.
Ses05F_impro06_F018 Thank you.
Ses05F_impro06_F019 Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.
Ses05F_impro06_F020 Thanks.
Ses05F_impro06_F021 It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...
Ses05F_impro06_F022 something happens and they die and it's like-
Ses05F_impro06_F023 really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.
Ses05F_impro06_F024 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F025 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_F026 It's hard to say good-bye.
Ses05F_impro06_F027 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F029 yeah yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M001 Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?
Ses05F_impro06_M002 That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?
Ses05F_impro06_M003 I am so sorry,  It's-
Ses05F_impro06_M004 It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?
Ses05F_impro06_M005 Absolutely, absolutely.
Ses05F_impro06_M006 It's the think
Ses05F_impro06_M007 There's no reason for it.
Ses05F_impro06_M008 Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?
Ses05F_impro06_M009 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M010 Is he an actor too, or-?
Ses05F_impro06_M011 Yes of course, of course.
Ses05F_impro06_M012 Was he very close to his family?
Ses05F_impro06_M013 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M014 Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.
Ses05F_impro06_M017 Is there a funeral planned? or-
Ses05F_impro06_M018 Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.
Ses05F_impro06_M019 No problem.
Ses05F_impro06_M020 Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.
Ses05F_impro06_M021 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_M022 Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.
Ses05F_impro06_M023 That's the best way to put it.
Ses05F_impro06_M024 Absolutely.
Ses05F_impro06_M025 Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.
Ses05F_impro07_F000 So guess what.
Ses05F_impro07_F001 I got into college.
Ses05F_impro07_F002 U.S.C..
Ses05F_impro07_F003 yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F004 No.
Ses05F_impro07_F005 I'll stay in town.
Ses05F_impro07_F006 Uh- I don't know.
Ses05F_impro07_F007 Well, I don't want to, I don't want to live with my mom.
Ses05F_impro07_F008 Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live?
Ses05F_impro07_F011 Whoa, this is going to be so much fun.
Ses05F_impro07_F012 Thank you. I know, I'm really, really, really excited.
Ses05F_impro07_F013 I know they have a really, really great program for what I want to do.
Ses05F_impro07_F014 Can we for real live together?
Ses05F_impro07_F015 awesome.
Ses05F_impro07_F016 So should we get a place near campus? or-
Ses05F_impro07_F017 okay.
Ses05F_impro07_F021 It's going to be ridiculous.  It's going to be so cool.
Ses05F_impro07_F023 [LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean.
Ses05F_impro07_F024 I- I hear the same.
Ses05F_impro07_F025 I don't know how I feel about that, but-
Ses05F_impro07_F026 oh yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F027 oh yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F028 [LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure.
Ses05F_impro07_F029 Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.
Ses05F_impro07_F030 [LAUGHTER] by yourself.
Ses05F_impro07_F031 you'd be that kid
Ses05F_impro07_F032 living near campus, and not going to school.
Ses05F_impro07_F033 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro07_F034 yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F035 We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.
Ses05F_impro07_F036 Let's go tomorrow.
Ses05F_impro07_F037 yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F038 Woo-
Ses05F_impro07_F039 exciting.
Ses05F_impro07_M000 what
Ses05F_impro07_M001 Shut up.  What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please
Ses05F_impro07_M002 Oh, sweet.
Ses05F_impro07_M003 So you're not going to leave me.
Ses05F_impro07_M004 oh, good good good good good good.
Ses05F_impro07_M005 Are you going to live on campus?  Where are you going to live?
Ses05F_impro07_M006 Uh! stay over here.  Like travel to school. because you are so close to me
Ses05F_impro07_M007 Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right,  right.  Maybe we should get a place together.
Ses05F_impro07_M008 That'll be awesome.
Ses05F_impro07_M009 I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so.
Ses05F_impro07_M011 But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.
Ses05F_impro07_M012 it is going to be so much fun. Yes.
Ses05F_impro07_M013 Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.
Ses05F_impro07_M014 Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C..
Ses05F_impro07_M015 You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.
Ses05F_impro07_M016 Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.
Ses05F_impro07_M017 That'll be great. That'll be great.
Ses05F_impro07_M018 We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?
Ses05F_impro07_M019 Yeah, me either.
Ses05F_impro07_M020 [garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun.
Ses05F_impro07_M021 You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though.
Ses05F_impro07_M024 Woo- I I do.
Ses05F_impro07_M025 I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you.
Ses05F_impro07_M026 You're a wild and crazy woman.
Ses05F_impro07_M027 Uh huh, it will be awesome.
Ses05F_impro07_M029 living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.
Ses05F_impro07_M030 Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Ses05F_impro07_M031 Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
Ses05F_impro07_M032 Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have-
Ses05F_impro07_M033 That's a good idea.
Ses05F_impro07_M034 Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow-
Ses05F_impro07_M035 Good.  We'll have to have one soon, you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months.
Ses05F_impro07_M036 Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage]
Ses05F_impro08_F000 Hi, sir.  How can I help you?
Ses05F_impro08_F001 Okay.
Ses05F_impro08_F002 [LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.
Ses05F_impro08_F003 I kwon, it is ridiculous
Ses05F_impro08_F004 yeah, I understand.
Ses05F_impro08_F005 Uh- when's when's-
Ses05F_impro08_F007 If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.
Ses05F_impro08_F008 Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?
Ses05F_impro08_F009 In the mail?
Ses05F_impro08_F010 So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?
Ses05F_impro08_F011 Okay.
Ses05F_impro08_F012 Okay.
Ses05F_impro08_F014 Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...
Ses05F_impro08_F015 if I call it up on the screen.
Ses05F_impro08_F016 So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?
Ses05F_impro08_F017 Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-
Ses05F_impro08_F018 Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-
Ses05F_impro08_F019 Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.
Ses05F_impro08_F020 You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?
Ses05F_impro08_F021 Yeah so- That --that did go through.
Ses05F_impro08_F022 Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.
Ses05F_impro08_F023 Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.
Ses05F_impro08_F024 Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.
Ses05F_impro08_F025 yeah.
Ses05F_impro08_F026 No problem.
Ses05F_impro08_F027 ahh one eight hundred three two three
Ses05F_impro08_F028 six four nine four
Ses05F_impro08_F029 You're welcome
Ses05F_impro08_F030 I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.
Ses05F_impro08_F032 Have a good day.
Ses05F_impro08_F033 bye bye
Ses05F_impro08_M004 This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me.
Ses05F_impro08_M005 Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being.
Ses05F_impro08_M007 Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.
Ses05F_impro08_M013 Okay, great, go ahead.
Ses05F_impro08_M016 No, No, No, I am grateful.
Ses05F_impro08_M018 Did they take-
Ses05F_impro08_M019 Yes, yes, exactly.
Ses05F_impro08_M020 Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?
Ses05F_impro08_M022 Right.
Ses05F_impro08_M025 That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.
Ses05F_impro08_M026 thank you, what's the number?
Ses05F_impro08_M027 three two three
Ses05F_impro08_M028 six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much.
Ses05F_impro08_M030 It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely
Ses05F_impro08_M031 You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
Ses05F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses05F_script01_1_F005 He cried hard.
Ses05F_script01_1_F006 He is thinking about him again.
Ses05F_script01_1_F007 It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.
Ses05F_script01_1_F008 What's the meaning of that?
Ses05F_script01_1_F017 Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?
Ses05F_script01_1_F024 Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.
Ses05F_script01_1_F025 Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
Ses05F_script01_1_F026 Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?
Ses05F_script01_1_F027 The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have
Ses05F_script01_1_F028 Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses05F_script01_1_F031 You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.
Ses05F_script01_1_F033 What the hell is this?
Ses05F_script01_1_F034 Are you crazy?
Ses05F_script01_1_F038 All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!
Ses05F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses05F_script01_1_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses05F_script01_1_M002 Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.
Ses05F_script01_1_M003 I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
Ses05F_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05F_script01_1_M005 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
Ses05F_script01_1_M006 I guess, he is.
Ses05F_script01_1_M007 I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses05F_script01_1_M008 Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses05F_script01_1_M009 You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
Ses05F_script01_1_M013 For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!
Ses05F_script01_1_M016 You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?
Ses05F_script01_1_M018 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses05F_script01_1_M025 To hell with that!
Ses05F_script01_1_M035 The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
Ses05F_script01_2_F001 She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?
Ses05F_script01_2_F006 She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses05F_script01_2_F010 I want you to pretend like he's coming back!
Ses05F_script01_2_F011 Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.
Ses05F_script01_2_F012 Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?
Ses05F_script01_2_F014 Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.
Ses05F_script01_2_F016 You've got to believe. You've got to--
Ses05F_script01_2_F017 I can't help it!
Ses05F_script01_2_M000 Why does that bother you?
Ses05F_script01_2_M001 Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.
Ses05F_script01_2_M002 What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.
Ses05F_script01_2_M016 What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!
Ses05F_script01_2_M017 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses05F_script01_3_F000 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses05F_script01_3_F001 No, it's good.
Ses05F_script01_3_F002 It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses05F_script01_3_F003 No.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses05F_script01_3_F006 Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.
Ses05F_script01_3_F008 Well, from her point of view why else would I come?
Ses05F_script01_3_F009 I guess this is why I came.
Ses05F_script01_3_F015 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!
Ses05F_script01_3_F016 Not like that, you're not.
Ses05F_script01_3_F017 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?
Ses05F_script01_3_F020 It wouldn't work like this.
Ses05F_script01_3_F021 yeah sure.
Ses05F_script01_3_F022 how many?
Ses05F_script01_3_F023 Oh gee.
Ses05F_script01_3_F024 Do you still feel like that?
Ses05F_script01_3_F025 Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses05F_script01_3_F026 What would I do with a fortune?
Ses05F_script01_3_M000 I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?
Ses05F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses05F_script01_3_M005 Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses05F_script01_3_M006 How did you know?
Ses05F_script01_3_M008 Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!
Ses05F_script01_3_M009 I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.
Ses05F_script01_3_M010 You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.
Ses05F_script01_3_M016 Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.
Ses05F_script01_3_M017 Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses05F_script01_3_M021 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
Ses05F_script01_3_M023 It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-
Ses05F_script01_3_M024 Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.
Ses05F_script01_3_M025 Yeah.  I lost them.
Ses05F_script01_3_M026 just about all.
Ses05F_script01_3_M027 Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-
Ses05F_script01_3_M028 for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.
Ses05F_script01_3_M029 I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.
Ses05F_script01_3_M030 I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.
Ses05F_script01_3_M031 And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-
Ses05F_script01_3_M032 but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?
Ses05F_script01_3_M033 And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.
Ses05F_script01_3_M034 And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.
Ses05F_script01_3_M035 It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.
Ses05F_script01_3_M036 And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and
Ses05F_script01_3_M037 It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!
Ses05F_script01_3_M039 I I want you now, Annie.
Ses05F_script01_3_M040 Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!
Ses05F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses05F_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses05F_script02_1_F005 yes.
Ses05F_script02_1_F007 It's after eleven, let's go home.
Ses05F_script02_1_F011 Not particularly.
Ses05F_script02_1_F012 I just don't.
Ses05F_script02_1_F015 I am just not.
Ses05F_script02_1_F016 Yes.
Ses05F_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--
Ses05F_script02_1_M001 actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?
Ses05F_script02_1_M002 Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?
Ses05F_script02_1_M003 Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.
Ses05F_script02_1_M009 Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?
Ses05F_script02_1_M010 I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.
Ses05F_script02_1_M011 [LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around
Ses05F_script02_1_M012 you want my jacket?
Ses05F_script02_1_M014 Right.
Ses05F_script02_1_M018 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.
Ses05F_script02_1_M019 Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.
Ses05F_script02_1_M020 Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.
Ses05F_script02_1_M021 This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah
Ses05F_script02_1_M023 Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.
Ses05F_script02_1_M024 There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.
Ses05F_script02_1_M029 Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?
Ses05F_script02_1_M030 Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.
Ses05F_script02_1_M031 Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.
Ses05F_script02_1_M032 It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.
Ses05F_script02_1_M033 They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.
Ses05F_script02_1_M034 Well, So what do you think?
Ses05F_script02_2_F005 God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.
Ses05F_script02_2_F013 Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.
Ses05F_script02_2_F014 We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses05F_script02_2_F015 And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
Ses05F_script02_2_F016 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses05F_script02_2_F017 I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.
Ses05F_script02_2_F018 No.
Ses05F_script02_2_F019 No.
Ses05F_script02_2_F025 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses05F_script02_2_F026 Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses05F_script02_2_F027 But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.
Ses05F_script02_2_F028 I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.
Ses05F_script02_2_F029 I didn't say that.
Ses05F_script02_2_F030 For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.
Ses05F_script02_2_F032 Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.
Ses05F_script02_2_F033 Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.
Ses05F_script02_2_F034 Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.
Ses05F_script02_2_F037 No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses05F_script02_2_M000 Well, so?  What do you think?
Ses05F_script02_2_M002 It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
Ses05F_script02_2_M003 I am not the only one, look at all these people.
Ses05F_script02_2_M005 Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?
Ses05F_script02_2_M010 Well We will see them this year.
Ses05F_script02_2_M016 Wait a minute, I got it.
Ses05F_script02_2_M018 Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?
Ses05F_script02_2_M019 You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses05F_script02_2_M020 Take off our shoes?
Ses05F_script02_2_M025 What.  Welcome to the human race.
Ses05F_script02_2_M031 No, I know me either.
Ses05F_script02_2_M032 Maybe if you are with somebody else too?
Ses05F_script02_2_M033 No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.
Ses05F_script02_2_M035 Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.
Ses05F_script02_2_M036 I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.
Ses05F_script02_2_M037 Well, look what we have got here.
Ses05F_script02_2_M040 Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses05F_script02_2_M041 Or not.
Ses05F_script03_1_F005 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
Ses05F_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses05F_script03_1_F007 Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.
Ses05F_script03_1_F010 The whole business is really rather ridiculous.
Ses05F_script03_1_F011 Meaning exactly that.
Ses05F_script03_1_F013 Who's they?
Ses05F_script03_1_F015 Well, what if-what happens when our love-
Ses05F_script03_1_F019 Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?
Ses05F_script03_1_F025 Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses05F_script03_1_F030 And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses05F_script03_1_F031 Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous
Ses05F_script03_1_F033 You knew there was nothing.
Ses05F_script03_1_M000 Good God.
Ses05F_script03_1_M001 I wonder.
Ses05F_script03_1_M005 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
Ses05F_script03_1_M007 With the most perfect poise.
Ses05F_script03_1_M011 What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
Ses05F_script03_1_M013 All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.
Ses05F_script03_1_M014 Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].
Ses05F_script03_1_M015 Who knows?
Ses05F_script03_1_M016 No, that fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses05F_script03_1_M017 It all depends on how well we played.
Ses05F_script03_1_M018 Yes, yes, with all his might.
Ses05F_script03_1_M019 No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.
Ses05F_script03_1_M020 no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --
Ses05F_script03_1_M021 enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.
Ses05F_script03_1_M022 Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses05F_script03_1_M024 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses05F_script03_1_M025 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
Ses05F_script03_1_M026 Horrible thing, I hate it.
Ses05F_script03_1_M027 How long did that row last?
Ses05F_script03_1_M028 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
Ses05F_script03_1_M029 Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses05F_script03_1_M030 Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses05F_script03_1_M031 [LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.
Ses05F_script03_1_M032 Oh, we were very much younger then.
Ses05F_script03_1_M033 Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses05F_script03_2_F000 You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05F_script03_2_F001 Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05F_script03_2_F003 You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses05F_script03_2_F004 maybe just a little, but--
Ses05F_script03_2_F005 And what of it?
Ses05F_script03_2_F006 Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.
Ses05F_script03_2_F010 I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.
Ses05F_script03_2_F011 Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.
Ses05F_script03_2_F012 It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F014 Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F018 Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F019 adder don't snap, they sting.
Ses05F_script03_2_F020 They sting.
Ses05F_script03_2_F021 I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.
Ses05F_script03_2_F022 Yes, I did quite a bit.
Ses05F_script03_2_F023 Mind your own business.
Ses05F_script03_2_F024 Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.
Ses05F_script03_2_F027 Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.
Ses05F_script03_2_F029 Why?
Ses05F_script03_2_F030 There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses05F_script03_2_F031 They're away in Tunis.
Ses05F_script03_2_F032 Turn it on again.
Ses05F_script03_2_F033 Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.
Ses05F_script03_2_F034 Well, do try to control yourself darling.
Ses05F_script03_2_F035 You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.
Ses05F_script03_2_F036 I- I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F037 I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F038 No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.
Ses05F_script03_2_F039 Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F040 Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.
Ses05F_script03_2_F041 Beast; brute; cad; whore
Ses05F_script03_2_M004 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?
Ses05F_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
Ses05F_script03_2_M008 Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses05F_script03_2_M009 So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?
Ses05F_script03_2_M010 I'll have a little I think.
Ses05F_script03_2_M013 You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
Ses05F_script03_2_M014 Really, Amanda.
Ses05F_script03_2_M016 Oh, that reply has broken my heart.
Ses05F_script03_2_M019 It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05F_script03_2_M022 They snap.
Ses05F_script03_2_M024 Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
Ses05F_script03_2_M025 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.
Ses05F_script03_2_M026 You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.
Ses05F_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.
Ses05F_script03_2_M038 Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_M039 Turn it off.
Ses05F_script03_2_M040 Amanda-- Listen- Listen-
Ses05F_script03_2_M041 Very music- amusing indeed.
Ses05F_script03_2_M042 You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.
Ses05F_script03_2_M043 Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.
Ses05M_impro01_F000 Can I help you?
Ses05M_impro01_F001 Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..
Ses05M_impro01_F002 Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.
Ses05M_impro01_F003 Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-
Ses05M_impro01_F004 No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --
Ses05M_impro01_F006 No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.
Ses05M_impro01_F009 I know.
Ses05M_impro01_F012 Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.
Ses05M_impro01_F021 I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.
Ses05M_impro01_F023 Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.
Ses05M_impro01_M005 I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.
Ses05M_impro01_M015 Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.
Ses05M_impro02_F012 What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?
Ses05M_impro02_F013 Well, they're so young.
Ses05M_impro02_F020 It's just so much.
Ses05M_impro02_F021 [GARBAGE] You have to write me everyday.
Ses05M_impro02_F023 okay.

Ses05M_impro02_M010 I know.
Ses05M_impro02_M011 I don't want to -- the kids.  You've got to take care of them.  You've got- you've got to-
Ses05M_impro02_M012 tell them about me and show them pictures of me and everything like that, because they are not going to see me for such a long time.  And it's such an important time and I just don't want to miss it.
Ses05M_impro02_M013 I don't have -- I know.  What are we gonna- What are we- just run away?  What can I do?  Where can we go?
Ses05M_impro02_M018 I know.  But I'll-I'll send the pictures all the time and I'll write them emails and you can read them the emails that I send them.
Ses05M_impro02_M019 I'm gonna be in Bagdad, just doing security.
Ses05M_impro02_M021 I just want to be honest with you.  I don't want you to .
Ses05M_impro02_M022 but, it's gonna be fine.  I'm gonna be fine.  You know I'm good at this.  I can do this.  That's why I trained all this time.  I'm good at this.  Okay?
Ses05M_impro02_M023 I know.  I know.  I know.  But, you know what?  That doesn't mean it's gonna be me; does it?
Ses05M_impro02_M024 No.  It doesn't.  And you can't think like that.
Ses05M_impro02_M025 I don't want you to -- I know.  I know. You can't worry about me.  You've got to worry about the kids.  And you've got to take care of the kids for me.  Okay?  Take care of the kids for me; all right?

Ses05M_impro03_M006 I did it up at Yosemite.  We went camping right like we usually do.  You know we go camping up there all the time.  But, um- the waterfalls had died down a little bit, you know. And so uh- we-I had her climb up.

Ses05M_impro03_M008 and you can climb it and it's covered in algae you know. So, I wanted her to climb it to go take a picture, like, back in this little waterfall area, and she got back there and she took her picture. And then, I had her come back.  And I was going to do the same thing.
Ses05M_impro03_M009 Well, instead I climb up on the rock and like I- I didn't do it -- well, I did it on purpose. I made it look like I accidentally did it.  I slipped down into this pool of water, right?  And she freaks out because I slide all the way down this rock.  And um-

Ses05M_impro04_F010 are you going into the bars every night?
Ses05M_impro04_F011 Well, I don't really know.  I don't I don't know you in like a job situation, so.
Ses05M_impro04_F012 Wow.  I don't -- I mean, do you- do you have an attitude problem when you're on the job?
Ses05M_impro04_F013 Maybe [garbage].
Ses05M_impro04_F014 Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.
Ses05M_impro04_F015 I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --
Ses05M_impro04_F016 Are you getting defensive?
Ses05M_impro04_F017 Yeah.  That might be something you want to look at.  I mean --
Ses05M_impro04_F018 Okay.
Ses05M_impro04_F019 I understand.
Ses05M_impro04_F020 Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that.
Ses05M_impro04_F021 ah.
Ses05M_impro04_F022 Not- Not selling pot, right?
Ses05M_impro04_F023 Okay so.
Ses05M_impro04_F024 Fair enough.
Ses05M_impro04_F026 Sorry.  So, let's see.  What else?  What's available? What? Um.  Hmm.
Ses05M_impro04_F027 Well, not off the top of head.  It will just take you know take a minute.  But do you have any, like, special skills?
Ses05M_impro04_F028 Well, maybe we can find you something with juggling.
Ses05M_impro04_F029 Have you checked out Craig's List and stuff?
Ses05M_impro04_F030 What if you do kids parties? oh, come on.
Ses05M_impro04_F031 Okay.  All right.
Ses05M_impro04_F032 Okay.  Well, fine. we won't- I won't argue with you about that.
Ses05M_impro04_F034 That's rough.  I'm really sorry, Ryan.
Ses05M_impro04_F035 Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?
Ses05M_impro04_F036 Okay.  Well, that's good.  Yeah, I mean, you're you're- when you're happy you're a pretty personable guy.  And I don't --I don't
Ses05M_impro04_F037 I can't see where the issue would be. so
Ses05M_impro04_M008 You plan on being there forever? I mean, Like, what do you --
Ses05M_impro04_M009 yeah.
Ses05M_impro04_M010 right.
Ses05M_impro04_M019 An abrasive vibe?
Ses05M_impro04_M020 Let me know that's -- that's fine.  You think I have an abrasive vibe, whatever.  You're entitled to your opinion, of course.  Maybe that's why I don't have a job.
Ses05M_impro04_M040 Yeah, well thanks for your help.
Ses05M_impro04_M041 I'll need it.
Ses05M_impro05_F000 Hmm. Hmm.
Ses05M_impro05_F001 How long ago was that?
Ses05M_impro05_F002 Uh-Hmm.
Ses05M_impro05_F003 Um, okay.  Well, you can fly- file a claim.  Where were you coming from?
Ses05M_impro05_F004 So, within the country, though? umm
Ses05M_impro05_F005 Yeah, well the chances of it being lost forever, you know, are slight because -- -- you were in the --
Ses05M_impro05_F006 Well, I mean, you know that happens pretty often that sometimes baggage -- -- gets lost.
Ses05M_impro05_F007 yeah.
Ses05M_impro05_F008 Okay.
Ses05M_impro05_F009 Did you have insurance on your flight?
Ses05M_impro05_F010 No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra.
Ses05M_impro05_F011 well, it's something that worth
Ses05M_impro05_F012 yeah, I don't know.
Ses05M_impro05_F013 Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.
Ses05M_impro05_F014 Um, well, there's not much I can do.  I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in.
Ses05M_impro05_F015 wow.
Ses05M_impro05_F016 Wow.  Well, that's really important, obviously.  But, um --
Ses05M_impro05_F017 Uh- Actually, I don't know that that's legal. Um- it is the issue
Ses05M_impro05_F018 Yeah I mean, Your bag might have been confiscated because it's --
Ses05M_impro05_F019 -- it's a biohazard. so- um
Ses05M_impro05_F020 Yeah.  Let me just call security.
Ses05M_impro05_F021 [LAUGHTER] Okay.  Hold on.
Ses05M_impro05_M000 Hi. Um-  My luggage didn't come out of the conveyor thingy.
Ses05M_impro05_M001 So, um, what do I do?
Ses05M_impro05_M002 Uh- Like, an hour and a half ago.  I talked to somebody who was standing out there and they said wait.  Sometimes like random butt- pieces come out late.
Ses05M_impro05_M003 And so I waited there, but nothing came.
Ses05M_impro05_M004 I was coming from um the Midwest, like Iowa.
Ses05M_impro05_M005 Yeah, I know I was in the country.  I mean, it's not that complicated.
Ses05M_impro05_M006 Well, I would hope so.
Ses05M_impro05_M007 People lose --
Ses05M_impro05_M009 You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage.
Ses05M_impro05_M010 I mean, it's not big or anything like that.  I mean, it's not worth a lot of money or anything.
Ses05M_impro05_M022 Thank you
Ses05M_impro06_F002 Oh, I'm so sorry
Ses05M_impro06_F003 Oh, my gosh.

Ses05M_impro06_F007 I'm sorry. I-
Ses05M_impro06_F008 Wow, Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that.
Ses05M_impro06_F009 Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.
Ses05M_impro06_F010 If there's anything I can do to be there for you.
Ses05M_impro06_M000 I just got some bad news.
Ses05M_impro06_M001 My friend, Shotty, passed away.
Ses05M_impro06_M002 The end, he's been sick for awhile.  He had cancer.
Ses05M_impro06_M003 Yeah.  It's just, I never thought it would actually happen, you know? I mean- He's such a fighter and he's always so positive about everything.
Ses05M_impro06_M004 You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --
Ses05M_impro06_M005 he wanted to travel, you know.  And he's so talented.  Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life.
Ses05M_impro06_M006 He was a designer, you know.  But he did everything. You know, He painted and he- and he did costume design, he did set design, he did lighting, he was --
Ses05M_impro06_M007 he just did everything.  He was literally, literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life.
Ses05M_impro06_M008 And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.
Ses05M_impro06_M009 I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then --
Ses05M_impro06_M010 you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time.
Ses05M_impro06_M011 And now I don't have that person anymore, you know.  And it's -- -- it's just, you.
Ses05M_impro06_M012 You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -
Ses05M_impro06_M013 and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-
Ses05M_impro06_M014 You always think, you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen, like, it will all be better when I am older, you know?
Ses05M_impro06_M017 No, you're right.  I don't.  You're right.
Ses05M_impro06_M018 Even, yeah -- he doesn't he would never feel that way, he would never want me to feel that way.  Of course not, but that's just where I am right now and -- -- I don't know what else to do with it.
Ses05M_impro06_M019 I just miss him.
Ses05M_impro06_M020 Thanks.
Ses05M_impro07_F000 What?
Ses05M_impro07_F001 Oh, for real?

Ses05M_impro07_F019 yeah.

Ses05M_impro07_M011 Finally.  I'm so excited.  We're gonna -- well, I'll be here.  We're still gonna be able to see each other.

Ses05M_impro07_M016 We are gonna have a great time.
Ses05M_impro07_M017 [garbage] I'm going to live on campus.  I mean, well, around campus, anyway.  Yeah, housing around campus.
Ses05M_impro07_M018 I just want to be really close to things, you know.  I know it's not exactly the best neighborhood in the entire world. But uh-
Ses05M_impro07_M019 I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway.
Ses05M_impro07_M020 They don't live here.  They don't know, right?
Ses05M_impro07_M021 yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_M022 Exactly.  You make it what you make it. You know? Right? And I'm gonna make it so freaking awesome.
Ses05M_impro07_M023 yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_M024 Well, I don't know.  I've got to go look for a place.
Ses05M_impro07_M025 Yeah, yeah.  I- I don't- I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?
Ses05M_impro07_M026 You know the area better than I do.
Ses05M_impro07_M028 Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?
Ses05M_impro07_M029 I don't care. I don't care.
Ses05M_impro07_M030 yeah?
Ses05M_impro07_M031 That would be perfect.
Ses05M_impro07_M032 Really?
Ses05M_impro07_M033 Really?
Ses05M_impro07_M034 Cheap is exactly what I need- Because I have no money at all.
Ses05M_impro07_M035 But, uh--
Ses05M_impro07_M036 Loans, scholarships, I've got a lot of scholarships-- Yeah, yeah. I'm- I'm half Native American so I get all those scholarships, too. yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_M037 So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so.
Ses05M_impro07_M039 And yeah, well, I mean, basically I just applied for any and every possible scholarship and grant that could come by, so I can go.
Ses05M_impro07_M040 Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's gonna work out.  I'm gonna be able to pay for it, I'm gonna go, I mean, I'll have a little debt in the end.  But I don't care.
Ses05M_impro07_M041 It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true?
Ses05M_impro07_M042 Oh I know, I know.
Ses05M_impro07_M043 But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right?
Ses05M_impro07_M044 Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy.
Ses05M_impro07_M045 I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.
Ses05M_impro07_M046 We'll have fun.
Ses05M_impro07_M047 Great.  Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_F005 Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.
Ses05M_impro08_F006 Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.
Ses05M_impro08_F007 Hmm. Mmm.
Ses05M_impro08_F008 yeah.
Ses05M_impro08_F009 It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.
Ses05M_impro08_F011 Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --
Ses05M_impro08_F012 Uh huh.
Ses05M_impro08_F013 All right.
Ses05M_impro08_F014 Yeah, I see that.
Ses05M_impro08_F015 Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_F016 Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_F017 Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.
Ses05M_impro08_F018 Uh huh, Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_F019 Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.
Ses05M_impro08_F022 Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.
Ses05M_impro08_F025 Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.
Ses05M_impro08_F026 Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.
Ses05M_impro08_F027 No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.
Ses05M_impro08_F028 Okay.  Thanks.
Ses05M_impro08_M000 D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?
Ses05M_impro08_M001 This happens every two weeks?
Ses05M_impro08_M002 You've lost your connection.
Ses05M_impro08_M003 okay.
Ses05M_impro08_M004 Hmm.  Mmm.
Ses05M_impro08_M005 Has somebody tried to pin your site?
Ses05M_impro08_M006 Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?
Ses05M_impro08_M007 Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?
Ses05M_impro08_M008 Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --
Ses05M_impro08_M009 Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.
Ses05M_impro08_M010 Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.
Ses05M_impro08_M011 Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?
Ses05M_impro08_M012 Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.
Ses05M_impro08_M013 Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?
Ses05M_impro08_M014 Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list.
Ses05M_impro08_M015 And hit enter.
Ses05M_impro08_M016 Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?
Ses05M_impro08_M017 Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.
Ses05M_impro08_M018 Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?
Ses05M_impro08_M019 It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.
Ses05M_impro08_M020 Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --
Ses05M_impro08_M021 Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.
Ses05M_impro08_M022 I completely understand.
Ses05M_impro08_M023 Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.
Ses05M_impro08_M024 Absolutely.  It's a new service we are offering.
Ses05M_impro08_M025 Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?
Ses05M_impro08_M026 Great.  Well, that makes me very happy.  That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme.  Is there anything else I can help you with?
Ses05M_impro08_M027 All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.
Ses05M_impro08_M028 All right.  Bye, bye.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F022 Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F023 Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F024 The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F026 Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F028 Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F031 Are you crazy?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F033 Must you be inspired?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F034 You don't want to think like that.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M002 About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M003 I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M004 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M005 Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M019 Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M020 She's not Larry's girl.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M022 what to hell with that!
Ses05M_script01_1b_M031 I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M032 But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M033 I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M035 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M036 Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M040 Well, I am thinking like that.
Ses05M_script01_1b_M041 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses05M_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
Ses05M_script01_1_F001 When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?
Ses05M_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses05M_script01_1_F005 He cried hard?
Ses05M_script01_1_F014 The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.
Ses05M_script01_1_F018 Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.
Ses05M_script01_1_F021 I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.
Ses05M_script01_1_F022 From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?
Ses05M_script01_1_F023 Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that
Ses05M_script01_1_F024 Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses05M_script01_1_F025 Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?
Ses05M_script01_1_F026 Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.
Ses05M_script01_1_F032 Are you crazy?
Ses05M_script01_1_F035 All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.
Ses05M_script01_1_F036 Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?
Ses05M_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
Ses05M_script01_1_M011 Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?
Ses05M_script01_1_M013 For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!
Ses05M_script01_1_M016 You know.
Ses05M_script01_1_M017 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses05M_script01_1_M020 Oh, so it isn't just my business?
Ses05M_script01_1_M021 You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.
Ses05M_script01_1_M022 Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses05M_script01_1_M023 She is not Larry's girl!
Ses05M_script01_1_M025 To hell with that!
Ses05M_script01_1_M028 So what?  I'm not fast with women.
Ses05M_script01_1_M032 I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.
Ses05M_script01_1_M033 But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.
Ses05M_script01_1_M034 I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.
Ses05M_script01_1_M035 I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
Ses05M_script01_1_M036 Yes.  On this, I would.
Ses05M_script01_1_M037 Well, you help me stay here.
Ses05M_script01_2_F002 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses05M_script01_2_F004 He's got that about it.
Ses05M_script01_2_F005 What's going on here, Joe?
Ses05M_script01_2_F015 You above all have got to believe.
Ses05M_script01_2_F017 I can't help it.
Ses05M_script01_2_M000 Why does that bother you?
Ses05M_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.
Ses05M_script01_2_M003 Why do you think he's even thinking that?
Ses05M_script01_2_M015 What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses05M_script01_2_M016 What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?
Ses05M_script01_3_F000 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses05M_script01_3_F001 It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses05M_script01_3_F003 Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.
Ses05M_script01_3_F006 I figured they would, your mother at least.
Ses05M_script01_3_F007 Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?
Ses05M_script01_3_F009 Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.
Ses05M_script01_3_F010 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses05M_script01_3_F012 Everyday since.
Ses05M_script01_3_F013 Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.
Ses05M_script01_3_F015 Not like that you're not.
Ses05M_script01_3_F016 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?
Ses05M_script01_3_F019 Even in your letters there was something ashamed.
Ses05M_script01_3_F020 You have to tell me.
Ses05M_script01_3_F021 It wouldn't work like this.
Ses05M_script01_3_F022 Yeah, sure.
Ses05M_script01_3_F023 How many?
Ses05M_script01_3_F024 Do you still feel like that?
Ses05M_script01_3_F025 Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.
Ses05M_script01_3_F027 [LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?
Ses05M_script01_3_M001 So, you're not sorry I came?
Ses05M_script01_3_M003 Well-
Ses05M_script01_3_M010 You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.
Ses05M_script01_3_M013 You felt something that far back?
Ses05M_script01_3_M016 oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?
Ses05M_script01_3_M017 Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses05M_script01_3_M019 Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.
Ses05M_script01_3_M020 No, nothing like that.
Ses05M_script01_3_M021 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.
Ses05M_script01_3_M022 I don't I don't know where to start.
Ses05M_script01_3_M023 It's so mixed up with so many other things.
Ses05M_script01_3_M025 I lost them.
Ses05M_script01_3_M026 Just about all.
Ses05M_script01_3_M027 It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.
Ses05M_script01_3_M029 I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.
Ses05M_script01_3_M030 I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.
Ses05M_script01_3_M033 It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.
Ses05M_script01_3_M036 I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.
Ses05M_script01_3_M039 And I guess that included you.
Ses05M_script01_3_M040 I want you now, Annie.
Ses05M_script01_3_M041 Oh, Annie,
Ses05M_script01_3_M042 Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
Ses05M_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses05M_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses05M_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses05M_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?
Ses05M_script02_1_M001 What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?
Ses05M_script02_1_M002 This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.
Ses05M_script02_1_M003 The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.
Ses05M_script02_1_M005 Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.
Ses05M_script02_1_M006 How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?
Ses05M_script02_1_M007 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses05M_script02_1_M008 I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]
Ses05M_script02_1_M009 Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something
Ses05M_script02_1_M010 Do you want my jacket?
Ses05M_script02_1_M017 Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.
Ses05M_script02_1_M018 I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.
Ses05M_script02_1_M019 Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,
Ses05M_script02_1_M020 and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.
Ses05M_script02_1_M021 I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.
Ses05M_script02_1_M023 All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.
Ses05M_script02_1_M028 Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.
Ses05M_script02_1_M029 Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;
Ses05M_script02_1_M030 somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-
Ses05M_script02_1_M031 And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,
Ses05M_script02_1_M032 they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.
Ses05M_script02_1_M033 Well, so what do you think?
Ses05M_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses05M_script02_2_F001 It's ridiculous.
Ses05M_script02_2_F005 God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.
Ses05M_script02_2_F009 Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever
Ses05M_script02_2_F010 No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.
Ses05M_script02_2_F012 I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.
Ses05M_script02_2_F013 Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses05M_script02_2_F014 And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
Ses05M_script02_2_F015 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses05M_script02_2_F016 I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.
Ses05M_script02_2_F017 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F018 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F019 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F022 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F023 I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.
Ses05M_script02_2_F026 But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.
Ses05M_script02_2_F027 This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?
Ses05M_script02_2_F028 I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.
Ses05M_script02_2_F029 But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses05M_script02_2_F030 I didn't say that.
Ses05M_script02_2_F031 For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.
Ses05M_script02_2_F032 Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.
Ses05M_script02_2_F034 Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.
Ses05M_script02_2_F037 No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses05M_script02_2_F038 Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2_M000 Well, so, what do you think?
Ses05M_script02_2_M001 What I was just saying.
Ses05M_script02_2_M005 uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?
Ses05M_script02_2_M016 It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?
Ses05M_script02_2_M024 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?
Ses05M_script02_2_M025 Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!
Ses05M_script02_2_M026 Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
Ses05M_script02_2_M029 Now, I know.  Me either
Ses05M_script02_2_M030 I'm trying the best I can.
Ses05M_script02_2_M031 Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?
Ses05M_script02_2_M032 No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
Ses05M_script02_2_M034 Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
Ses05M_script02_2_M035 I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.
Ses05M_script02_2_M036 Oh, well look what we've got here.
Ses05M_script02_2_M037 Well, it isn't champagne.
Ses05M_script02_2_M040 Or not.
Ses05M_script03_1_F001 what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.
Ses05M_script03_1_F002 What do we do?
Ses05M_script03_1_F003 Now and always, my sweet.
Ses05M_script03_1_F004 It was bound to happen sooner or later.
Ses05M_script03_1_F005 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
Ses05M_script03_1_F011 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses05M_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses05M_script03_1_F013 If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.
Ses05M_script03_1_F015 Well, will we always bicker and fight?
Ses05M_script03_1_F017 What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?
Ses05M_script03_1_F020 Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses05M_script03_1_F024 I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses05M_script03_1_F026 Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses05M_script03_1_F031 You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05M_script03_1_M001 I wonder.
Ses05M_script03_1_M003 We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?
Ses05M_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses05M_script03_1_M006 Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.
Ses05M_script03_1_M007 With the worst- with the most perfect poise?
Ses05M_script03_1_M008 Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--
Ses05M_script03_1_M009 things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses05M_script03_1_M010 Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.
Ses05M_script03_1_M011 Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.
Ses05M_script03_1_M012 Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
Ses05M_script03_1_M013 You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.
Ses05M_script03_1_M014 All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.
Ses05M_script03_1_M015 uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.
Ses05M_script03_1_M016 Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.
Ses05M_script03_1_M018 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
Ses05M_script03_1_M020 Yes, yes, with all his might.
Ses05M_script03_1_M021 No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.
Ses05M_script03_1_M022 So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.
Ses05M_script03_1_M023 [garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses05M_script03_1_M024 I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.
Ses05M_script03_1_M025 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses05M_script03_1_M026 The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.
Ses05M_script03_1_M027 Horrible thing.  I hated it.
Ses05M_script03_1_M028 How long did that roue last?
Ses05M_script03_1_M029 Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?
Ses05M_script03_1_M030 [LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses05M_script03_1_M031 Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses05M_script03_1_M032 I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
Ses05M_script03_1_M033 We were very much younger then.
Ses05M_script03_2_F001 Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05M_script03_2_F002 Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
Ses05M_script03_2_F004 Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.
Ses05M_script03_2_F005 Well, what of it.
Ses05M_script03_2_F006 Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
Ses05M_script03_2_F009 No thanks.
Ses05M_script03_2_F012 It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05M_script03_2_F015 Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05M_script03_2_F017 No, it isn't.
Ses05M_script03_2_F018 No, it it is not, be quiet.
Ses05M_script03_2_F023 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses05M_script03_2_F026 You always had a weak head.
Ses05M_script03_2_F028 Not- Would you shut up.
Ses05M_script03_2_F034 Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.
Ses05M_script03_2_F035 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses05M_script03_2_F036 Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.
Ses05M_script03_2_F037 You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.
Ses05M_script03_2_F038 Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.
Ses05M_script03_2_F039 This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.
Ses05M_script03_2_F040 Yes, I am. Let go with me
Ses05M_script03_2_F041 You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!
Ses05M_script03_2_F042 Beast
Ses05M_script03_2_F043 Brute
Ses05M_script03_2_F044 pig
Ses05M_script03_2_M008 Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses05M_script03_2_M009 Me, too, bored stiff.
Ses05M_script03_2_M010 Do you want some brandy?
Ses05M_script03_2_M011 I think I'll have a little.
Ses05M_script03_2_M015 Amanda, really.
Ses05M_script03_2_M020 It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses05M_script03_2_M023 They snap.
Ses05M_script03_2_M024 So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
Ses05M_script03_2_M025 You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?
Ses05M_script03_2_M026 I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.
Ses05M_script03_2_M027 I am not the slightest bit drunk.
Ses05M_script03_2_M028 I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.
Ses05M_script03_2_M029 Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?
Ses05M_script03_2_M030 You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.
Ses05M_script03_2_M031 You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
Ses05M_script03_2_M032 You better turn that off, I think.
Ses05M_script03_2_M033 Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.
Ses05M_script03_2_M034 Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.
Ses05M_script03_2_M035 This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses05M_script03_2_M036 I do I shall do no such thing.
Ses05M_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses05M_script03_2_M038 Turn it off!
Ses05M_script03_2_M039 Very amusing indeed.
Ses05M_script03_2_M040 Ja! Very funny.
Ses05M_script03_2_M041 You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.
Ses05M_script03_2_M042 Oh, you're not going like this.
Ses05M_script03_2_M043 [GARBAGE] No, you're not.
Ses05M_script03_2_M044 oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.
Ses05M_script03_2_M045 You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.
