Ses01F_impro01_M011 I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.
Ses01F_impro01_M013 Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.
Ses01F_impro02_M001 I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.
Ses01F_impro02_M005 I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.
Ses01F_impro02_M009 I just don't see why it has to be you.
Ses01F_impro02_M010 What am I going to do? Huh?
Ses01F_impro02_M011 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro02_M012 Don't you guys have access to computers over there.
Ses01F_impro02_M013 I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.
Ses01F_impro02_M014 I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?
Ses01F_impro02_M015 I know.
Ses01F_impro03_M000 So what's up?  What's new?
Ses01F_impro03_M001 Yeah.  I heard.
Ses01F_impro03_M003 Who did you marry?
Ses01F_impro03_M006 He turned to you and was like...
Ses01F_impro03_M007 [LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.
Ses01F_impro03_M008 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro03_M009 Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?
Ses01F_impro03_M011 Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?
Ses01F_impro03_M013 Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro03_M014 Is that your phone?
Ses01F_impro03_M015 He loves you.
Ses01F_impro03_M016 How much did he win at the slot?
Ses01F_impro03_M019 I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.
Ses01F_impro03_M020 But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.
Ses01F_impro03_M021 like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.
Ses01F_impro03_M022 Awesome.
Ses01F_impro03_M023 [LAUGHTER] Cat babies.
Ses01F_impro03_M024 That's fair enough.
Ses01F_impro04_M000 Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?
Ses01F_impro04_M001 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M002 No.  There's regular jobs on there.
Ses01F_impro04_M003 Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro04_M004 I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.
Ses01F_impro04_M005 He's like a manager for a theatre.
Ses01F_impro04_M006 He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.
Ses01F_impro04_M007 You did?
Ses01F_impro04_M008 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M009 You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?
Ses01F_impro04_M010 Hmm.
Ses01F_impro04_M011 I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--
Ses01F_impro04_M012 Yeah.  Do you have a resume?
Ses01F_impro04_M013 It's kind of helpful when getting a job.
Ses01F_impro04_M014 Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.
Ses01F_impro04_M015 No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--
Ses01F_impro04_M016 Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.
Ses01F_impro04_M017 No.  But it has an outline, you know.
Ses01F_impro04_M018 I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--
Ses01F_impro04_M019 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro04_M020 Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.
Ses01F_impro04_M021 Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.
Ses01F_impro04_M022 maybe get a car.
Ses01F_impro04_M023 I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.
Ses01F_impro04_M024 I didn't say that.
Ses01F_impro04_M025 I am riding the bus, but by choice.
Ses01F_impro04_M026 To save the environment, carpool.
Ses01F_impro04_M027 Yes.  One less car at a time.
Ses01F_impro04_M028 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro04_M031 I don't think I'm anyone.
Ses01F_impro04_M032 I- I-I didn't-- okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M000 Hi.  Thanks for waiting.
Ses01F_impro05_M001 Can I help you?
Ses01F_impro05_M002 Uh huh.
Ses01F_impro05_M003 Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M004 Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M005 Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.
Ses01F_impro05_M006 Okay.
Ses01F_impro05_M007 all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?
Ses01F_impro05_M008 Uh-huh.
Ses01F_impro05_M009 Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--
Ses01F_impro05_M010 I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-
Ses01F_impro05_M011 we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...
Ses01F_impro05_M012 for such an inconvenience and your bag, but
Ses01F_impro05_M013 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro05_M014 No, no.
Ses01F_impro05_M015 No, no.  This is real.
Ses01F_impro05_M016 No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...
Ses01F_impro05_M017 this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.
Ses01F_impro05_M019 Yes.
Ses01F_impro05_M020 I know.
Ses01F_impro05_M022 Okay. Calm-
Ses01F_impro05_M023 Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really
Ses01F_impro05_M024 We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.
Ses01F_impro05_M025 It's a gift.
Ses01F_impro05_M026 You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.
Ses01F_impro05_M027 With the amount of--
Ses01F_impro05_M028 Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?
Ses01F_impro05_M029 Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--
Ses01F_impro05_M030 Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.
Ses01F_impro05_M031 Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.
Ses01F_impro05_M034 If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--
Ses01F_impro05_M035 Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...
Ses01F_impro06_M000 I'm sorry, Joy.
Ses01F_impro06_M001 Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?
Ses01F_impro06_M002 ...pick up anything?
Ses01F_impro06_M003 You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.
Ses01F_impro06_M004 Hmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M005 Oh.  She was there?
Ses01F_impro06_M006 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M007 Yeah.
Ses01F_impro06_M008 How long were you there for?
Ses01F_impro06_M009 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M010 Oh really?
Ses01F_impro06_M011 You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_M012 Is it a big cemetery?
Ses01F_impro06_M013 Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?
Ses01F_impro06_M014 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M015 Mmhmm.
Ses01F_impro06_M016 So she wrote a lot of poetry?
Ses01F_impro07_M000 Did you get the letter?
Ses01F_impro07_M001 Yeah. That is so awesome.
Ses01F_impro07_M002 Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_impro07_M003 Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.
Ses01F_impro07_M004 Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?
Ses01F_impro07_M005 This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.
Ses01F_impro07_M006 A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.
Ses01F_impro07_M007 I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo.
Ses01F_impro07_M008 Yeah.  Big time.
Ses01F_impro07_M009 Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?
Ses01F_impro07_M012 Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice
Ses01F_impro07_M013 That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?
Ses01F_impro07_M014 Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.
Ses01F_impro07_M015 You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.
Ses01F_impro07_M017 Yay...School's fun.
Ses01F_impro07_M018 Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.
Ses01F_impro07_M019 That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.
Ses01F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses01F_script01_1_M001 He was out here when it broke.
Ses01F_script01_1_M002 Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.
Ses01F_script01_1_M003 I don't know.
Ses01F_script01_1_M004 I guess he is.
Ses01F_script01_1_M007 You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
Ses01F_script01_1_M010 We've got to say it to him.
Ses01F_script01_1_M012 Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.
Ses01F_script01_1_M014 You know.
Ses01F_script01_1_M015 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01F_script01_1_M016 You know it's not just my business.
Ses01F_script01_1_M017 So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?
Ses01F_script01_1_M019 You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses01F_script01_1_M023 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses01F_script01_1_M024 Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.
Ses01F_script01_1_M025 And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.
Ses01F_script01_1_M034 I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.
Ses01F_script01_1_M039 On this, I would.
Ses01F_script01_1_M040 Then help me stay here.
Ses01F_script01_2_M001 Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses01F_script01_2_M004 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses01F_script01_2_M008 How do you know why she waited?
Ses01F_script01_2_M017 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses01F_script01_3_M000 I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?
Ses01F_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came.
Ses01F_script01_3_M003 Well.
Ses01F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses01F_script01_3_M005 Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.
Ses01F_script01_3_M008 I love you. Annie, I love you.
Ses01F_script01_3_M009 I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.
Ses01F_script01_3_M010 Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.
Ses01F_script01_3_M015 Why didn't you let me know?
Ses01F_script01_3_M016 Give me a...
Ses01F_script01_3_M017 Give me a kiss.
Ses01F_script01_3_M019 Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.
Ses01F_script01_3_M020 I kissed you.
Ses01F_script01_3_M021 Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.
Ses01F_script01_3_M022 No it's nothing like that. It's-
Ses01F_script01_3_M023 Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.
Ses01F_script01_3_M024 I don't even know how to start.
Ses01F_script01_3_M025 It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses01F_script01_3_M026 Well I lost them.
Ses01F_script01_3_M027 Pretty much all.
Ses01F_script01_3_M028 You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?
Ses01F_script01_3_M029 Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.
Ses01F_script01_3_M030 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.
Ses01F_script01_3_M032 To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.
Ses01F_script01_3_M033 But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.
Ses01F_script01_3_M036 And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.
Ses01F_script01_3_M037 I just want you to know Annie.
Ses01F_script02_1_M002 Okay.  Is that, is that--
Ses01F_script02_1_M007 The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?
Ses01F_script02_1_M008 Whose is it?
Ses01F_script02_1_M009 Oh...well. Yeah, of course.
Ses01F_script02_1_M010 No.
Ses01F_script02_1_M011 Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.
Ses01F_script02_1_M013 Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?
Ses01F_script02_1_M014 Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.
Ses01F_script02_1_M015 Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?
Ses01F_script02_1_M016 God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.
Ses01F_script02_1_M020 Right.
Ses01F_script02_1_M021 Wait, that's my point, too.
Ses01F_script02_1_M023 Why not?
Ses01F_script02_1_M024 Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.
Ses01F_script02_1_M025 Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.
Ses01F_script02_1_M026 This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.
Ses01F_script02_1_M029 There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.
Ses01F_script02_1_M031 God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?
Ses01F_script02_1_M032 And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.
Ses01F_script02_1_M033 Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.
Ses01F_script02_1_M034 We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.
Ses01F_script02_1_M035 Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.
Ses01F_script02_1_M036 God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.
Ses01F_script02_1_M038 Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.
Ses01F_script02_1_M040 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.
Ses01F_script02_1_M043 So what do you think?
Ses01F_script02_1_M044 About all of that, about all I was talking about.
Ses01F_script02_2_M000 Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.
Ses01F_script02_2_M001 Well, so, what do you think?
Ses01F_script02_2_M002 About what I was saying.
Ses01F_script02_2_M006 Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?
Ses01F_script02_2_M016 Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.
Ses01F_script02_2_M017 Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.
Ses01F_script02_2_M019 It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.
Ses01F_script02_2_M021 Sure.  All right.  Okay.
Ses01F_script02_2_M022 Listen, do you want to dance?
Ses01F_script02_2_M023 Do you want me to go get some champagne?
Ses01F_script02_2_M024 Do you want to take off your shoes?
Ses01F_script02_2_M026 Do you want to get married again?
Ses01F_script02_2_M033 Yes it is.
Ses01F_script02_2_M037 Maybe if you were with someone else, too.
Ses01F_script02_2_M038 I just- I know I don't make you happy.
Ses01F_script02_2_M040 You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
Ses01F_script02_2_M042 We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?
Ses01F_script02_2_M043 [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M044 And look what I got here.
Ses01F_script02_2_M046 [BREATHING]
Ses01F_script02_2_M047 Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?
Ses01F_script02_2_M048 Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.
Ses01F_script02_2_M049 Or not.
Ses01F_script03_1_M005 I don't care then.
Ses01F_script03_1_M007 No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M008 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M009 With perfect poise.
Ses01F_script03_1_M010 It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
Ses01F_script03_1_M013 Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
Ses01F_script03_1_M018 Who knows?
Ses01F_script03_1_M021 Yes.  Yes with all of his might.
Ses01F_script03_1_M024 Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.
Ses01F_script03_1_M025 Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
Ses01F_script03_1_M026 Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.
Ses01F_script03_1_M034 That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses01F_script03_1_M036 [LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01F_script03_1_M037 [LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.
Ses01F_script03_2_M001 However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_M002 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
Ses01F_script03_2_M004 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses01F_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses01F_script03_2_M010 I'll have a little, I think.
Ses01F_script03_2_M011 No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.
Ses01F_script03_2_M014 Really, Amanda.
Ses01F_script03_2_M016 you going out somewhere, dear?
Ses01F_script03_2_M018 Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.
Ses01F_script03_2_M019 Yes it is.
Ses01F_script03_2_M020 Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.
Ses01F_script03_2_M021 Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.
Ses01F_script03_2_M022 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.
Ses01F_script03_2_M023 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses01F_script03_2_M024 And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.
Ses01F_script03_2_M025 I think I am not in the least bit drunk.
Ses01F_script03_2_M026 I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.
Ses01F_script03_2_M027 That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.
Ses01F_script03_2_M029 Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.
Ses01F_script03_2_M030 Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.
Ses01F_script03_2_M031 This is no time of year for Tunis.
Ses01F_script03_2_M032 I will do no such thing.
Ses01F_script03_2_M033 Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.
Ses01F_script03_2_M034 Turn it off.
Ses01F_script03_2_M035 Amanda, listen, listen.
Ses01F_script03_2_M036 Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.
Ses01F_script03_2_M037 You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses01F_script03_2_M038 You're not going like this.
Ses01F_script03_2_M039 You're not.
Ses01F_script03_2_M040 Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses01M_impro01_M003 Yes, Jones.
Ses01M_impro01_M010 No, I don't have a passport.
Ses01M_impro01_M020 Did you even look at the form?  I filled it out all these questions--
Ses01M_impro01_M025 I am not...I'm not getting to back that line.
Ses01M_impro01_M030 Why?
Ses01M_impro01_M031 Why, because I'm sick of talking to you.
Ses01M_impro01_M032 'Cause you're obviously not talking to me, you're just yelling at me, berating me and telling me I can't fill out forms right.
Ses01M_impro02_M000 Hey, Joy come in here.
Ses01M_impro02_M001 I have to go back.
Ses01M_impro02_M002 I just got a letter I have to go back.
Ses01M_impro02_M003 First thing tomorrow morning.
Ses01M_impro02_M007 The National Guard is I guess really spread thin and then everyone has to go.  We all have to go back, my whole companies going back.
Ses01M_impro02_M009 So yeah, we leave tomorrow...
Ses01M_impro02_M010 ...we're all shipping out.
Ses01M_impro02_M011 I just got I feel like I'm in shock actually.
Ses01M_impro02_M012 I don't know.
Ses01M_impro02_M013 I guess you're just going to have to have it without me.
Ses01M_impro02_M014 Hey listen, it's going to be okay though, all right?
Ses01M_impro02_M015 You're going to be fine.
Ses01M_impro02_M016 I'm going to be fine too, okay?
Ses01M_impro02_M017 I know I have a good... I have a really good group of guys with me.
Ses01M_impro02_M018 We're going to be okay.
Ses01M_impro02_M019 Do promise me you're going to take a lot of pictures.
Ses01M_impro02_M020 I know.
Ses01M_impro02_M021 I just wish there was something I could do.
Ses01M_impro02_M022 Run away?
Ses01M_impro02_M023 I really don't want to go, I don't want to go...
Ses01M_impro02_M025 I love you.
Ses01M_impro03_M000 The craziest thing just happened to me.
Ses01M_impro03_M001 This girl; she just offered me fifty thousand dollars to marry her.
Ses01M_impro03_M003 Well, she's not a citizen so she wants to get a visa.
Ses01M_impro03_M004 No, no, no, no, no, no she just... she's not a citizen but she wants her visa, yeah. She's going to pay me fifty thousand dollars to marry her and stay married to her for two years.
Ses01M_impro03_M005 That's like twenty five thousand dollar a year for doing nothing. Isn't that awesome?
Ses01M_impro03_M006 She's actually from England, I think.  Well she- she spoke English but she had an accent. I didn't even ask.
Ses01M_impro03_M007 Fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand dollars. I was just out... I just... she's - well, she's a friend of friend but like...
Ses01M_impro03_M008 Yeah.  Can you believe that? Yeah, she's like hey, I'm like sure I'll do it, I don't care. Yeah. I'm like fifty thousand dollars, I'd totally do it for fifty thousand dollars. But the only thing is that's kind of like illegal. So like I could go to jail probably for a long if I get caught, but...
Ses01M_impro03_M010 It's like I'm really going to get married. We'll have like the whole thing.
Ses01M_impro03_M011 Oh, good. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_impro03_M012 I know. What do you think I should-
Ses01M_impro03_M013 Oh good idea.
Ses01M_impro03_M014 Yeah.  Make her like open the bank account and stuff too.
Ses01M_impro03_M015 It's a good idea.
Ses01M_impro03_M016 I know.  Also I get to like plan the wedding now too. That will be fun.
Ses01M_impro03_M017 Something blue, something new, something... no I don't know. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, wonder if she's going to pay me up front but do you think it's bad though, do you think they're going to like track the money or something?
Ses01M_impro03_M018 Just cash hardcore.
Ses01M_impro03_M019 What should we do?  Where should we get married? We should have party.
Ses01M_impro03_M020 Yeah, like a big like- A wedding on the beach, that would be nice.
Ses01M_impro03_M021 And then we can honeymoon.  I want to go tropical though like Bahamas- --or like Tahiti or something. I just want to like beach and like drink.
Ses01M_impro03_M022 I'll make her pay for that.  I hear she's like totally wealthy. She's like royalty- --or something like and- --whatever like removed or something but yeah.
Ses01M_impro03_M023 I'm going to marry a blue blood. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_impro03_M024 Will you help me plan?
Ses01M_impro04_M014 What?
Ses01M_impro04_M018 Okay. Okay no, no, no, no okay no, I need to hear this more. Come on, bring it.
Ses01M_impro04_M023 I'm like a sponge I'm like soaked up with all this information for like three years I'm just dying for a job to like put it in to.
Ses01M_impro04_M025 That's it.
Ses01M_impro05_M004 Are you insinuating that I don't have a college education and that- for some reason that makes you a better person than I am?
Ses01M_impro05_M005 Listen, shut your smug mouth, okay?  I don't need that.
Ses01M_impro05_M006 I've been sitting here for four hours.
Ses01M_impro05_M007 You people have just been tossing me around like a used hanky.
Ses01M_impro05_M008 You work here.
Ses01M_impro05_M015 Okay.
Ses01M_impro05_M020 Probably people that work for your company huh?
Ses01M_impro05_M021 Do you know what was in that little bag that I could have just easily put in overhead compartment but no I had to check?
Ses01M_impro05_M022 My computer which has all of my data which I'm collecting right now.
Ses01M_impro05_M023 Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that.  So I need to have that back.
Ses01M_impro05_M024 Fifty dollars is not going to cover me for my job, okay?
Ses01M_impro05_M025 Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags?  Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.
Ses01M_impro05_M026 It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.
Ses01M_impro05_M027 Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.
Ses01M_impro05_M028 I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.
Ses01M_impro05_M031 Thank you very much.
Ses01M_impro06_M000 Yeah, I'm just-- yeah
Ses01M_impro06_M001 Just kind of feel numb, you know.
Ses01M_impro06_M002 You didn't even hear?
Ses01M_impro06_M003 [BREATHING] Umm.
Ses01M_impro06_M004 God I've told this story so many times. Umm.
Ses01M_impro06_M005 I just...I just basically lost someone that was really close to me.
Ses01M_impro06_M006 And I've kind of been dealing with all of the...the stuff, you know the hospital and people work because...
Ses01M_impro06_M007 He kind of didn't have anyone to take care of that for him, so--
Ses01M_impro06_M008 It's just really...really messed up.
Ses01M_impro06_M009 No.
Ses01M_impro06_M010 Just like it.
Ses01M_impro06_M011 No, I mean it just came on really quick, you know I mean it was a [GARBAGE] it was a sickness but it just --
Ses01M_impro06_M012 What?
Ses01M_impro06_M013 He was sick. He got sick. He got sick but it happened really, really fast, you know.
Ses01M_impro06_M014 It was kind of like boom... done
Ses01M_impro06_M015 It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...
Ses01M_impro06_M016 --it just kind of freaks you out.
Ses01M_impro06_M017 So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.
Ses01M_impro06_M018 Exactly, you know, and like he had so many plans and he was going to do...
Ses01M_impro06_M019 so many things, you know?
Ses01M_impro06_M020 What?
Ses01M_impro06_M021 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro06_M022 He was a really, really good guy.
Ses01M_impro06_M023 A lot of people loved him.
Ses01M_impro06_M024 You know, it's like affecting a lot of people it's not just me, you know?
Ses01M_impro06_M025 Umm...
Ses01M_impro06_M026 For like eight years.
Ses01M_impro06_M027 Yeah.
Ses01M_impro06_M028 Yeah, I'm glad I was there. Glad I- glad I got to be there.
Ses01M_impro06_M029 So weird,
Ses01M_impro06_M030 like I can't...it's like you know it's like "pinch me" it's like I can't believe like I'm dealing with this, you know.
Ses01M_impro07_M000 Check this out.  You know how I've told you I've been really into like softball recently?
Ses01M_impro07_M001 Well, this is totally random, I got this full ride scholarship to go to U.S.C next year to play softball.
Ses01M_impro07_M002 For softball.  They're going to pay me to go to school. Isn't that awesome?
Ses01M_impro07_M003 Yeah.  Well, I don't--well yeah I can pitch, I'm not like the pitcher though. I'm like the pinch hitter guy I mostly just hit.  But I guess I'm going to have to... Yeah, and then I play shortstop too but... It's so ex- The good news is I get to stay here.
Ses01M_impro07_M004 I know. For softball, yeah.
Ses01M_impro07_M005 Yeah, everything. Every like- free ride and I get to, you know, like be on like a Trojans sports team too. And it's like cool. Isn't it awesome?
Ses01M_impro07_M006 I don't know. I should ask. Yeah, I will.
Ses01M_impro07_M007 Thank you.
Ses01M_impro07_M008 But I don't know I want to live in the housing that they give me though 'cause I think I want to you know like get like a nicer place.
Ses01M_impro07_M009 Where should I move?
Ses01M_impro07_M010 That's a really good idea. Or I could go to like Santa Monica. Go beach. Venice beach, yeah a little dirty though. I don't want to go to Venice beach. But - Malibu. All right.
Ses01M_impro07_M011 Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_impro07_M013 Oh yeah, that would be.  Well, depends on what type of car you had, though too. I guess it would be worth it. helicopter. Yeah, helicopter.  There is a helipad there, right? Yeah, exactly.
Ses01M_impro07_M017 They do it's--believe me it's huge.
Ses01M_impro07_M018 I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...
Ses01M_impro07_M019 It's pretty wild.
Ses01M_impro07_M020 Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE]
Ses01M_impro07_M024 For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time?
Ses01M_impro07_M026 Yeah we have like away games and stuff.
Ses01M_impro07_M030 But you know I'm like [GARBAGE].
Ses01M_impro07_M032 I'm going to have a mustache...On the force...
Ses01M_impro07_M033 Pull over..
Ses01M_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses01M_script01_1_M002 I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.
Ses01M_script01_1_M003 I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.
Ses01M_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.
Ses01M_script01_1_M005 Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.
Ses01M_script01_1_M006 I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_1_M007 I guess he is.
Ses01M_script01_1_M017 I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Ses01M_script01_1_M020 See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?
Ses01M_script01_1_M021 She is not Larry's girl.
Ses01M_script01_1_M023 To hell with that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M024 No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.
Ses01M_script01_1_M034 Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses01M_script01_1_M035 Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M037 Yes, on this I would.
Ses01M_script01_1_M038 Then help me stay here mom.
Ses01M_script01_1_M040 Then help me stay.
Ses01M_script01_1_M041 I am thinking like that.
Ses01M_script01_1_M042 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses01M_script01_2_M000 Well, maybe he wanted see her.
Ses01M_script01_2_M001 Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?
Ses01M_script01_2_M007 And how do you know why she's waited.
Ses01M_script01_2_M015 What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?
Ses01M_script01_2_M016 Look at you. You're shaking.
Ses01M_script01_2_M017 What the hell do you want from me, Kate?
Ses01M_script01_3_M000 Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?
Ses01M_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses01M_script01_3_M002 Why not?
Ses01M_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses01M_script01_3_M006 You did?
Ses01M_script01_3_M007 Yeah--
Ses01M_script01_3_M009 Ann, I love you.  I love you.
Ses01M_script01_3_M014 Why didn't you?
Ses01M_script01_3_M016 why didn't you let me know?
Ses01M_script01_3_M018 I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.
Ses01M_script01_3_M019 I kissed you.
Ses01M_script01_3_M020 Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.
Ses01M_script01_3_M021 No, no, it's nothing like that.
Ses01M_script01_3_M022 I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.
Ses01M_script01_3_M023 I don't know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M024 It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.
Ses01M_script01_3_M025 you know over seas I was in command of the company?
Ses01M_script01_3_M026 Well I lost them.
Ses01M_script01_3_M027 Pretty much all.
Ses01M_script01_3_M028 Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M029 For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.
Ses01M_script01_3_M030 He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.
Ses01M_script01_3_M031 They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...
Ses01M_script01_3_M032 And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...
Ses01M_script01_3_M033 You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.
Ses01M_script01_3_M034 I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...
Ses01M_script01_3_M035 You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...
Ses01M_script01_3_M036 And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.
Ses01M_script01_3_M037 Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.
Ses01M_script01_3_M038 'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...
Ses01M_script01_3_M039 And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.
Ses01M_script01_3_M040 I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.
Ses01M_script01_3_M041 I want you to know Annie.
Ses01M_script01_3_M043 I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses01M_script02_1_M000 What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.
Ses01M_script02_1_M001 Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good.
Ses01M_script02_1_M002 Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--
Ses01M_script02_1_M004 Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?
Ses01M_script02_1_M005 Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?
Ses01M_script02_1_M007 Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?
Ses01M_script02_1_M009 Oh, well, yeah of course.
Ses01M_script02_1_M010 Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.
Ses01M_script02_1_M011 Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.
Ses01M_script02_1_M014 You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack.
Ses01M_script02_1_M016 Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid.
Ses01M_script02_1_M017 I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.
Ses01M_script02_1_M022 Right.
Ses01M_script02_1_M023 That's my point too.
Ses01M_script02_1_M028 People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.
Ses01M_script02_1_M030 Yeah, they do.
Ses01M_script02_1_M031 Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.
Ses01M_script02_1_M032 It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.
Ses01M_script02_1_M037 We just weren't in a good spot though.
Ses01M_script02_1_M039 Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...
Ses01M_script02_1_M040 Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...
Ses01M_script02_1_M041 They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction...
Ses01M_script02_1_M042 They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...
Ses01M_script02_1_M043 Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...
Ses01M_script02_1_M044 And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...
Ses01M_script02_1_M045 It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.
Ses01M_script02_1_M046 It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.
Ses01M_script02_2_M001 ...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...
Ses01M_script02_2_M002 Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.
Ses01M_script02_2_M003 Well, so?  What do you think?
Ses01M_script02_2_M008 Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?
Ses01M_script02_2_M013 We missed them twice.
Ses01M_script02_2_M019 you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.
Ses01M_script02_2_M020 Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go."
Ses01M_script02_2_M021 So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--
Ses01M_script02_2_M022 Wait a minute, I've got it.
Ses01M_script02_2_M023 It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?
Ses01M_script02_2_M025 Oh right sure, of course.
Ses01M_script02_2_M027 You want me to go get some champagne?
Ses01M_script02_2_M028 Do you want to take off our shoes?
Ses01M_script02_2_M029 What? Huh?
Ses01M_script02_2_M030 You want to get married again?
Ses01M_script02_2_M033 A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?
Ses01M_script02_2_M035 You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.
Ses01M_script02_2_M037 No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--
Ses01M_script02_2_M038 No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.
Ses01M_script02_2_M039 Yeah, it is.
Ses01M_script02_2_M040 Right.
Ses01M_script02_2_M041 I know me neither.
Ses01M_script02_2_M042 I'm doing the best I can.
Ses01M_script02_2_M043 Maybe if you were with somebody else too?
Ses01M_script02_2_M044 No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.
Ses01M_script02_2_M045 Yeah?
Ses01M_script02_2_M049 Look what we got here.
Ses01M_script02_2_M050 It's not champagne.
Ses01M_script02_2_M051 Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?
Ses01M_script02_2_M052 Shh...
Ses01M_script02_2_M053 If we are really quiet, the fish might come.
Ses01M_script02_2_M054 Or not.
Ses01M_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses01M_script03_1_M010 With perfect poise...
Ses01M_script03_1_M011 Ah...
Ses01M_script03_1_M012 Ah...Strange...
Ses01M_script03_1_M013 Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?
Ses01M_script03_1_M014 Darling, don't say that.
Ses01M_script03_1_M016 Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?
Ses01M_script03_1_M017 You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want.
Ses01M_script03_1_M019 Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.
Ses01M_script03_1_M021 We are figures of fun all right
Ses01M_script03_1_M022 Ahh...who knows.
Ses01M_script03_1_M028 Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]
Ses01M_script03_1_M029 Come here darling, kiss me
Ses01M_script03_1_M030 before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
Ses01M_script03_1_M031 See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome.
Ses01M_script03_1_M033 Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?
Ses01M_script03_1_M037 But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.
Ses01M_script03_1_M039 I will never forget the look on his face.
Ses01M_script03_1_M040 oh...
Ses01M_script03_1_M041 We were very much younger then.
Ses01M_script03_2_M012 I'll have a little, I think.
Ses01M_script03_2_M013 Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.
Ses01M_script03_2_M018 Are you going out somewhere dear?
Ses01M_script03_2_M022 You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.
Ses01M_script03_2_M023 You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.
Ses01M_script03_2_M024 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
Ses01M_script03_2_M025 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses01M_script03_2_M026 I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.
Ses01M_script03_2_M027 I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.
Ses01M_script03_2_M028 I am not in the least bit drunk.
Ses01M_script03_2_M029 I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.
Ses01M_script03_2_M030 Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots.
Ses01M_script03_2_M031 That's a very good idea I think I will.
Ses01M_script03_2_M032 Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.
Ses01M_script03_2_M033 Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.
Ses01M_script03_2_M034 This is no time a year for Tunis.
Ses01M_script03_2_M035 I will do no such thing.
Ses01M_script03_2_M036 Turn it off. It's driving me mad.
Ses01M_script03_2_M037 Turn it off.
Ses01M_script03_2_M038 Amanda listen. Listen.
Ses01M_script03_2_M039 That's very amusing indeed.
Ses01M_script03_2_M040 You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.
Ses01M_script03_2_M041 You're not going like this.
Ses01M_script03_2_M042 No you're not.
Ses01M_script03_2_M043 Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
Ses02F_impro01_F000 Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration.
Ses02F_impro01_F018 Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?
Ses02F_impro01_F019 Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.
Ses02F_impro01_F020 With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.
Ses02F_impro01_F021 Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.
Ses02F_impro02_F000 It's almost time for me to go.
Ses02F_impro02_F001 There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know--
Ses02F_impro02_F002 You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can.
Ses02F_impro02_F003 I don't think so.
Ses02F_impro02_F004 Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile.
Ses02F_impro02_F005 You could send me pictures.
Ses02F_impro02_F006 Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all--
Ses02F_impro02_F007 and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.
Ses02F_impro02_F008 I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and--
Ses02F_impro02_F009 You can just remember it for me.
Ses02F_impro02_F010 Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it.
Ses02F_impro02_F011 I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know
Ses02F_impro02_F012 I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger.
Ses02F_impro02_F013 I have no choice. There's nothing I can do.
Ses02F_impro03_F000 Oh my God.  Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what?
Ses02F_impro03_F001 Well, guess.  Guess, guess, guess, guess.

Ses02F_impro03_F011 'Cause- 'Cause he was with me. You didn't do it did you?
Ses02F_impro03_F012 You didn't know anything?
Ses02F_impro03_F013 I was just--it was so like I thought this might happen eventually, but like not yet, you know what I mean?  Like--
Ses02F_impro03_F014 It is good.  It's totally good.  I mean, it like oh, you know.
Ses02F_impro03_F015 I know. So we're gonna take it--Like we're not gonna get married right away--'Cause we want to like have plenty of time to plan everything out
Ses02F_impro03_F016 ...and, um, my parents want to like be part of it and help out and everything--So we want to give it lots of time to like--
Ses02F_impro03_F017 Yeah, yeah, I called them. I called them And, of course, they were so excited 'cause they love him. Like they always have.  Um--
Ses02F_impro03_F018 So, yeah, I mean, it'll be good.  We wanna like, uh, I think we're gonna have it in spring time, like early Spring--So it's no too hot yet.  And um--

Ses02F_impro03_F028 It's so girly.  I don't even know how to like--It's so weird, but it'll be fun.  My mom will love to be like--she'll get so into it, I'm sure.
Ses02F_impro03_F029 She'll be like--flowers and the--
Ses02F_impro03_F030 Oh, thank you. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02F_impro04_F009 I feel so worthless.
Ses02F_impro04_F016 I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.
Ses02F_impro05_F000 Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage.
Ses02F_impro05_F001 No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?
Ses02F_impro05_F004 How much?
Ses02F_impro05_F006 That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?
Ses02F_impro05_F010 Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.
Ses02F_impro05_F019 It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.
Ses02F_impro06_F000 Um, Johnny died yesterday.
Ses02F_impro06_F001 We knew that it was coming, but--
Ses02F_impro06_F002 It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well.
Ses02F_impro06_F003 Yeah.
Ses02F_impro06_F004 I just don't want him to be gone.
Ses02F_impro06_F005 And his whole family was there.
Ses02F_impro06_F006 I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know
Ses02F_impro06_F007 He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about...
Ses02F_impro06_F008 ...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--
Ses02F_impro06_F009 Nobody's ever gonna forget him.
Ses02F_impro06_F010 He did a lot.  But--
Ses02F_impro06_F011 I'm gonna forget him.
Ses02F_impro06_F012 I won't be able to hear his voice or his--
Ses02F_impro06_F013 You start to lose like that image after a while.
Ses02F_impro06_F014 Thanks.
Ses02F_impro07_F001 I got into U.S.C.
Ses02F_impro07_F002 Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say--
Ses02F_impro07_F003 Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway.
Ses02F_impro07_F004 So--
Ses02F_impro07_F005 Yeah, I know.
Ses02F_impro07_F006 Absolutely. I'm so excited.
Ses02F_impro07_F007 I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like...
Ses02F_impro07_F008 ...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school
Ses02F_impro07_F009 and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like...
Ses02F_impro07_F010 You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C.
Ses02F_impro07_F011 And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you...
Ses02F_impro07_F012 ...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean?
Ses02F_impro07_F013 Like it has some prestige. so
Ses02F_impro07_F014 Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine--
Ses02F_impro07_F015 Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind.
Ses02F_impro07_F016 I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know--
Ses02F_impro07_F017 Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know
Ses02F_impro07_F018 I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited.
Ses02F_impro07_F019 Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate.
Ses02F_impro07_F020 You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want.
Ses02F_impro07_F021 Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first...
Ses02F_impro07_F022 ...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean?
Ses02F_impro07_F023 So, um, so I don't know.
Ses02F_impro07_F024 I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.
Ses02F_impro07_F025 I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean.
Ses02F_impro07_F026 I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C..  You know what I mean.
Ses02F_impro07_F027 And you'll be like...
Ses02F_impro07_F028 Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much.
Ses02F_impro07_F029 [BREATHING]
Ses02F_impro07_F030 I know.  I'm excited.
Ses02F_impro07_F031 Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE]
Ses02F_impro07_F032 That's going to be a lot of work.
Ses02F_impro07_F033 But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun.
Ses02F_impro07_F034 I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good.
Ses02F_impro07_F035 I know. I know. So fun.  I can't wait.
Ses02F_impro07_F036 I will. I will. Thank you.
Ses02F_impro07_F037 Thanks.
Ses02F_impro08_F000 Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you?
Ses02F_impro08_F001 All right, sir.
Ses02F_impro08_F002 I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.
Ses02F_impro08_F003 Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?
Ses02F_impro08_F004 Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.
Ses02F_impro08_F005 I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,
Ses02F_impro08_F006 um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.
Ses02F_impro08_F007 Is that all right?
Ses02F_impro08_F008 I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.
Ses02F_impro08_F009 All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-
Ses02F_impro08_F010 um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.
Ses02F_impro08_F011 Absolutely. we we
Ses02F_impro08_F012 Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.
Ses02F_impro08_F013 So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.
Ses02F_impro08_F014 Yeah.
Ses02F_impro08_F015 Okay.
Ses02F_impro08_F016 Great.  How many seats?
Ses02F_impro08_F017 Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.
Ses02F_impro08_F018 Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?
Ses02F_impro08_F019 Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?
Ses02F_impro08_F020 Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?
Ses02F_impro08_F021 All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.
Ses02F_impro08_F022 So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.
Ses02F_impro08_F023 Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.
Ses02F_impro08_F024 And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.
Ses02F_impro08_F025 Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.
Ses02F_impro08_F026 Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.
Ses02F_impro08_F027 Thank you.
Ses02F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses02F_script01_1_F005 He cried hard?
Ses02F_script01_1_F006 What was he doing out here at that hour?
Ses02F_script01_1_F017 I've got an idea, but what's the story?
Ses02F_script01_1_F018 Well, that's only your business, Chris.
Ses02F_script01_1_F019 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses02F_script01_1_F021 I'm just saying that--
Ses02F_script01_1_F025 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02F_script01_1_F026 [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses02F_script01_1_F027 Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses02F_script01_1_F028 Trouble is, you don't see enough women.
Ses02F_script01_1_F036 Are you crazy?
Ses02F_script01_1_F037 What about the business?  What the hell is this?
Ses02F_script01_1_F038 Must you be inspired?
Ses02F_script01_1_F040 Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses02F_script01_1_F044 I can see that.
Ses02F_script01_2_F005 It's got that all about it.
Ses02F_script01_2_F012 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...
Ses02F_script01_2_F013 But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.
Ses02F_script01_3_F009 from her point of view, why else would I come?
Ses02F_script01_3_F012 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses02F_script01_3_F013 You started to write me and--
Ses02F_script01_3_F014 Every day since.
Ses02F_script01_3_F016 I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses02F_script01_3_F020 Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.
Ses02F_script01_3_F021 You've gotta tell me.
Ses02F_script01_3_F022 It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02F_script01_3_F023 Yeah, sure.
Ses02F_script01_3_F024 How many?
Ses02F_script01_3_F025 Oh, gee.
Ses02F_script01_3_F026 You still feel that way?
Ses02F_script01_3_F029 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02F_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses02F_script02_1_F005 Yeah.
Ses02F_script02_1_F019 We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses02F_script02_1_F021 About what?
Ses02F_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses02F_script02_2_F005 God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses02F_script02_2_F006 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02F_script02_2_F011 I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.
Ses02F_script02_2_F015 Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.
Ses02F_script02_2_F016 I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses02F_script02_2_F017 And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses02F_script02_2_F018 And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
Ses02F_script02_2_F019 Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses02F_script02_2_F020 I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses02F_script02_2_F021 No.
Ses02F_script02_2_F022 No.
Ses02F_script02_2_F024 No.
Ses02F_script02_2_F031 Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses02F_script02_2_F033 I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.
Ses02F_script02_2_F034 I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses02F_script02_2_F035 I didn't say that.
Ses02F_script02_2_F038 You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses02F_script02_2_F041 Augie, you brought refreshments.
Ses02F_script02_2_F042 Well, then we don't need glasses.
Ses02F_script02_2_F043 No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses02F_script02_2_F044 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses02F_script02_2_F045 Or not.
Ses02F_script03_1_F005 Ah, it send shivers up my spine.
Ses02F_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses02F_script03_1_F007 Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy.
Ses02F_script03_1_F008 What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses02F_script03_1_F009 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses02F_script03_1_F010 Yes, meaning just that.
Ses02F_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses02F_script03_1_F013 If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.
Ses02F_script03_1_F014 Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.
Ses02F_script03_1_F015 Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses02F_script03_1_F016 Oh, dear, shall we like that?
Ses02F_script03_1_F017 Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses02F_script03_1_F019 Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.
Ses02F_script03_1_F020 Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses02F_script03_1_F021 Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
Ses02F_script03_1_F022 Which particular one?
Ses02F_script03_1_F023 Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses02F_script03_1_F024 Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses02F_script03_1_F025 It went in intermittently for days.
Ses02F_script03_1_F026 It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02F_script03_1_F027 That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses02F_script03_1_F028 The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses02F_script03_1_F029 It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.
Ses02F_script03_2_F007 Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.
Ses02F_script03_2_F011 Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02F_script03_2_F012 Well, it's become a habit with you.
Ses02F_script03_2_F013 Don't be so stupid.
Ses02F_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses02F_script03_2_F016 A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?
Ses02F_script03_2_F018 Oh, be quiet.
Ses02F_script03_2_F020 Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses02F_script03_2_F025 You're quite insufferable
Ses02F_script03_2_F029 Shut up.
Ses02F_script03_2_F031 Why?
Ses02F_script03_2_F034 Turn it on again, please.
Ses02F_script03_2_F035 Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses02F_script03_2_F036 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses02F_script03_2_F037 Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses02F_script03_2_F038 Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.
Ses02F_script03_2_F039 I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses02F_script03_2_F040 This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.
Ses02F_script03_2_F041 Oh Yes, I am.
Ses02F_script03_2_F042 I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.
Ses02F_script03_2_F043 Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.
Ses02M_impro01_F000 Hi, How can I help you?
Ses02M_impro01_F001 Sure, um
Ses02M_impro01_F002 do you have two forms of ID with you?
Ses02M_impro01_F003 I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro01_F004 Well
Ses02M_impro01_F005 I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.
Ses02M_impro01_F006 Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.
Ses02M_impro01_F015 I'm sorry, sir.
Ses02M_impro01_F016 there is nothing I can do.
Ses02M_impro02_F000 I don't want you to go.
Ses02M_impro02_F001 I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.
Ses02M_impro02_F002 I don't want to be a single mom.
Ses02M_impro02_F003 but
Ses02M_impro02_F004 It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll
Ses02M_impro02_F005 I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_F006 I hope so.
Ses02M_impro02_F007 It's going to be really rough.
Ses02M_impro02_F008 I'll send you lots of pictures.
Ses02M_impro02_F009 Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.
Ses02M_impro02_F010 I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get
Ses02M_impro02_F012 Will you write me letters, paper ones?
Ses02M_impro02_F013 Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.
Ses02M_impro02_F014 I'll miss you too.
Ses02M_impro03_F000 What? What? You look really happy what's going on?
Ses02M_impro03_F001 Finally did what?
Ses02M_impro03_F003 Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did
Ses02M_impro03_F004 Did she say yes?
Ses02M_impro03_F005 That's like the most definitive.
Ses02M_impro03_F007 I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.
Ses02M_impro03_F008 Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?
Ses02M_impro03_F011 Oh, You did not.
Ses02M_impro03_F012 Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute
Ses02M_impro03_F013 That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God.
Ses02M_impro03_F014 She must have flipped out.
Ses02M_impro03_F015 Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_F016 Did you bring her up on stage too?
Ses02M_impro03_F017 Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.
Ses02M_impro03_F018 Are your parents excited or...?
Ses02M_impro03_F020 Ooh, that would be fun.
Ses02M_impro03_F023 Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool.
Ses02M_impro03_F024 Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]
Ses02M_impro03_F028 Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.
Ses02M_impro04_F000 So how you feeling?
Ses02M_impro04_F001 You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?
Ses02M_impro04_F002 Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -
Ses02M_impro04_F003 you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.
Ses02M_impro04_F004 Well, but you care about what you do, right?
Ses02M_impro04_F005 I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh
Ses02M_impro04_F006 Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.
Ses02M_impro04_F007 You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's
Ses02M_impro04_F008 Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.
Ses02M_impro04_F009 I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro04_F010 That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like
Ses02M_impro04_F011 and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.
Ses02M_impro04_F012 So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.
Ses02M_impro04_F014 You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.
Ses02M_impro04_F015 But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.
Ses02M_impro04_F016 Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.
Ses02M_impro05_F000 Hi, can I help you?
Ses02M_impro05_F001 Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-
Ses02M_impro05_F002 Okay. Well, um- the f.
Ses02M_impro05_F003 Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-
Ses02M_impro05_F004 Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-
Ses02M_impro05_F005 Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that
Ses02M_impro05_F006 Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.
Ses02M_impro05_F007 Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.
Ses02M_impro05_F008 I- I- I understand, but um.
Ses02M_impro05_F009 Okay
Ses02M_impro05_F010 Right.
Ses02M_impro05_F011 I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-
Ses02M_impro05_F012 Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and
Ses02M_impro05_F013 they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.
Ses02M_impro05_F014 So we'll- what we'll do
Ses02M_impro05_F015 Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.
Ses02M_impro05_F016 Um, so.
Ses02M_impro05_F017 We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know
Ses02M_impro05_F018 I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.
Ses02M_impro05_F019 I understand, so-
Ses02M_impro05_F020 all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage
Ses02M_impro05_F021 and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-
Ses02M_impro05_F023 Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-
Ses02M_impro05_F024 The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-
Ses02M_impro05_F025 Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have
Ses02M_impro05_F026 we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-
Ses02M_impro06_F002 It doesn't make any easier, yes.
Ses02M_impro06_F003 Oh, man. I'm so sorry.
Ses02M_impro06_F004 It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.
Ses02M_impro06_F005 Yeah.
Ses02M_impro06_F006 Totally.
Ses02M_impro06_F007 Yeah
Ses02M_impro06_F008 Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.
Ses02M_impro06_F009 She really cared about you, you know.
Ses02M_impro06_F010 And she was
Ses02M_impro06_F011 Yeah.
Ses02M_impro06_F012 Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.
Ses02M_impro06_F013 Are you going to be okay?
Ses02M_impro06_F014 It's going to be okay, I promise.
Ses02M_impro06_F015 Sure
Ses02M_impro06_F016 you shouldn't be alone
Ses02M_impro06_F017 Yes.
Ses02M_impro06_F018 Yes.
Ses02M_impro07_F000 Oh, yeah? Have you gotten letters yet?
Ses02M_impro07_F001 Um, I don't know, where?
Ses02M_impro07_F003 Oh my Gosh, that's so cool.
Ses02M_impro07_F004 [LAUGHTER] It's gotta be it, like-
Ses02M_impro07_F005 Oh my Gosh, that's so cool.
Ses02M_impro07_F006 big packet is gotta be the real thing. yeah
Ses02M_impro07_F007 Oh my Gosh. I thought there was like, maybe going to be some, like I don't know if you are going to get in or not, so I'm really glad that you did.
Ses02M_impro07_F008 That's so cool.
Ses02M_impro07_F009 Yeah, totally.
Ses02M_impro07_F010 So you're going to be right here in Los Angeles; that is so cool.
Ses02M_impro07_F011 So can we hang out?
Ses02M_impro07_F012 Yay.
Ses02M_impro07_F013 Oh, yay. Thank you. [LAUGHTER].
Ses02M_impro07_F014 No but that's an awesome school. That's so cool.
Ses02M_impro07_F015 Oh, totally totally.

Ses02M_impro07_F017 Like you get to be a part of that. Like the, like the- Like a cult.
Ses02M_impro07_F018 [LAUGHTER] like a- like a- [LAUGHTER] No, but I mean like everywhere you go people know who you are.
Ses02M_impro07_F019 So you know what you are going to do there?
Ses02M_impro07_F020 Okay. They have a lot of good schools, right?

Ses02M_impro08_F000 Hi. Thank you so much, you're a real person, right, you're not like a recording?
Ses02M_impro08_F001 Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-
Ses02M_impro08_F002 it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there.
Ses02M_impro08_F006 Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes
Ses02M_impro08_F007 Thank you very much. Um  So I have a charge on my credit card that, um, isn't mine.
Ses02M_impro08_F008 Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so
Ses02M_impro08_F010 Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something
Ses02M_impro08_F019 I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-
Ses02M_impro08_F023 Great.
Ses02M_impro08_F024 Yeah.
Ses02M_impro08_F025 Right, right.
Ses02M_impro08_F026 Okay, great.
Ses02M_impro08_F027 Yeah, totally.
Ses02M_impro08_F028 Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.
Ses02M_impro08_F030 Thank you very much bye.
Ses02M_script01_1_F015 I got an idea but what's the story?
Ses02M_script01_1_F018 Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-
Ses02M_script01_1_F021 From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.
Ses02M_script01_1_F023 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
Ses02M_script01_1_F025 How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
Ses02M_script01_1_F026 Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.
Ses02M_script01_1_F027 I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses02M_script01_1_F032 What the hell is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_F033 What the hell is this, are you crazy?
Ses02M_script01_1_F034 What about the business? What is this?
Ses02M_script01_1_F035 Must you be inspired?
Ses02M_script01_1_F036 Tell me, you'd leave the business?
Ses02M_script01_1_F037 Well, you don't want to think like that.
Ses02M_script01_1_F041 Yea, I can see that.
Ses02M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses02M_script01_2_F001 She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-
Ses02M_script01_2_F002 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses02M_script01_2_F003 He's not going to marry her.
Ses02M_script01_2_F005 What's going on here Joe?
Ses02M_script01_2_F006 -She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.
Ses02M_script01_2_F010 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense
Ses02M_script01_2_F013 I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.
Ses02M_script01_3_F001 It's all right.  It's a good thing.
Ses02M_script01_3_F002 You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.
Ses02M_script01_3_F003 No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.
Ses02M_script01_3_F007 I knew they would, your mother anyway.
Ses02M_script01_3_F008 Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?
Ses02M_script01_3_F009 I guess this is why I came.
Ses02M_script01_3_F012 Well, you started to write me
Ses02M_script01_3_F013 Every day since.
Ses02M_script01_3_F019 Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.
Ses02M_script01_3_F021 It wouldn't work this way.
Ses02M_script01_3_F025 Do you still feel that way?
Ses02M_script01_3_F026 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.
Ses02M_script01_3_F027 I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses02M_script01_3_F028 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses02M_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses02M_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses02M_script02_1_F005 Yea.
Ses02M_script02_1_F006 I'm cold.
Ses02M_script02_1_F011 Not particularly.
Ses02M_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses02M_script02_1_F017 Yes.
Ses02M_script02_1_F018 Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.
Ses02M_script02_1_F020 That's the wind.
Ses02M_script02_1_F021 About what?
Ses02M_script02_2_F005 Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
Ses02M_script02_2_F006 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses02M_script02_2_F011 I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.
Ses02M_script02_2_F013 I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.
Ses02M_script02_2_F015 Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.
Ses02M_script02_2_F016 We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses02M_script02_2_F017 And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them
Ses02M_script02_2_F018 and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be
Ses02M_script02_2_F019 Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses02M_script02_2_F020 I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses02M_script02_2_F021 No.
Ses02M_script02_2_F022 No.
Ses02M_script02_2_F031 Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses02M_script02_2_F034 I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses02M_script02_2_F037 Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?
Ses02M_script02_2_F038 You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses02M_script02_2_F042 Well, I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses02M_script02_2_F044 Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses02M_script02_2_F045 Or not.
Ses02M_script02_2_F046 Hmm.
Ses02M_script03_1_F002 What are we going to do?
Ses02M_script03_1_F003 Now and always sweet.
Ses02M_script03_1_F005 Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.
Ses02M_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses02M_script03_1_F007 Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.
Ses02M_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses02M_script03_1_F015 Oh dear, should we like that?
Ses02M_script03_1_F021 Which particular one?
Ses02M_script03_1_F022 Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.
Ses02M_script03_1_F023 I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses02M_script03_1_F024 It went on intermittently for days.
Ses02M_script03_1_F025 It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses02M_script03_1_F027 The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses02M_script03_1_F028 Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.
Ses02M_script03_1_F029 And very much sillier.
Ses02M_script03_2_F000 You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses02M_script03_2_F001 Presents, just a trivial little broach.
Ses02M_script03_2_F002 No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses02M_script03_2_F003 No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses02M_script03_2_F005 What of it?
Ses02M_script03_2_F006 It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.
Ses02M_script03_2_F007 Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.
Ses02M_script03_2_F009 No thanks.
Ses02M_script03_2_F011 It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
Ses02M_script03_2_F012 Well, it's become a habit with you.
Ses02M_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses02M_script03_2_F015 No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses02M_script03_2_F019 Be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_F023 I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
Ses02M_script03_2_F024 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses02M_script03_2_F028 Oh be quiet.
Ses02M_script03_2_F035 You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.
Ses02M_script03_2_F036 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.
Ses02M_script03_2_F037 Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.
Ses02M_script03_2_F038 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.
Ses02M_script03_2_F039 This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.
Ses02M_script03_2_F040 Oh yes I am.
Ses02M_script03_2_F041 Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.
Ses02M_script03_2_F042 You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.
Ses03F_impro01_M001 Oh, um-
Ses03F_impro01_M002 You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.
Ses03F_impro01_M003 Who?
Ses03F_impro01_M004 She- she probably doesn't even work here.
Ses03F_impro01_M005 All right  Uh-
Ses03F_impro02_M000 All right.
Ses03F_impro02_M001 She's doing fine. She just took her first steps today actually. I videotaped it for you so you can watch it.
Ses03F_impro02_M007 I can't- No, I can't do this alone.
Ses03F_impro02_M014 I have to work.
Ses03F_impro02_M016 You can't leave your daughter alone like this.
Ses03F_impro02_M017 You can't postpone it?
Ses03F_impro02_M018 I don't know if I can handle you going another year.
Ses03F_impro02_M019 I don't know if I- if I could take it.
Ses03F_impro02_M020 I can't be that strong. A whole year.
Ses03F_impro02_M021 me, oh my god.
Ses03F_impro02_M024 It doesn't look very good.
Ses03F_impro02_M025 I don't want the money. I want-you here
Ses03F_impro02_M027 If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.
Ses03F_impro02_M028 How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?
Ses03F_impro02_M029 How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.
Ses03F_impro02_M031 All right, then.
Ses03F_impro03_M000 Oh, my God, look at that. Huh-oh, how many carats is that?
Ses03F_impro03_M001 Like eighteen? [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_impro03_M002 Oh, Jesus.
Ses03F_impro03_M005 yeah [LAUGHTER]
Ses03F_impro03_M006 Yeah, The Lousy Chaperone. [LAUGHTER] Uh huh.
Ses03F_impro03_M007 [LAUGHTER] Uh- Drowsy.
Ses03F_impro03_M010 Oh, my God.
Ses03F_impro03_M015 No, you deserve to cry. I mean, tears of happiness.
Ses03F_impro03_M021 That's awesome. [LAUGHTER] Marriage.
Ses03F_impro04_M000 Hey, you just got to keep on going.
Ses03F_impro04_M001 No, don't think like that.
Ses03F_impro04_M002 Russel Crowe wasn't forty until he got his big stuff.
Ses03F_impro04_M003 If you really want to do it-I mean,
Ses03F_impro04_M004 you got to do.
Ses03F_impro04_M005 You could. You could. We just--
Ses03F_impro04_M006 we're just pooling our funds together.
Ses03F_impro04_M007 You don't owe me anything.
Ses03F_impro04_M008 You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared.
Ses03F_impro04_M009 Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that.
Ses03F_impro04_M010 You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five.
Ses03F_impro04_M011 Yeah.
Ses03F_impro04_M012 What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.
Ses03F_impro04_M013 See? So you can't just quit now.
Ses03F_impro04_M014 Have you been going to auditions and stuff?
Ses03F_impro04_M015 How's the job? Still waiting tables at Denny's?
Ses03F_impro04_M016 Well, they tip well.
Ses03F_impro04_M017 Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.
Ses03F_impro04_M018 Go back to school. You know? Another three more years, get your master's.
Ses03F_impro04_M019 Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough.
Ses03F_impro05_M003 Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.
Ses03F_impro05_M008 and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.
Ses03F_impro05_M009 Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.
Ses03F_impro05_M011 I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.
Ses03F_impro05_M013 Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me.
Ses03F_impro05_M014 What, do you have questions?
Ses03F_impro06_M000 How you doing?
Ses03F_impro06_M001 We're all going to miss him.
Ses03F_impro06_M002 I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.
Ses03F_impro06_M003 yeah.
Ses03F_impro06_M004 He was in chemo the whole time, right?
Ses03F_impro06_M005 And he just got that baseball scholarship.
Ses03F_impro06_M006 How's his parents doing?
Ses03F_impro06_M007 You guys were pretty close, weren't you?
Ses03F_impro06_M008 What was her name?
Ses03F_impro06_M009 Trying to have a baby.
Ses03F_impro06_M010 Some people.
Ses03F_impro06_M011 Yeah, but you were there all the hospital days. By his bed-
Ses03F_impro06_M012 So nice, so positive.
Ses03F_impro06_M013 We need more people like him.
Ses03F_impro06_M014 I don't know.
Ses03F_impro06_M015 I don't know if Benny was smart like that- but-
Ses03F_impro06_M016 I'm sure he loved you too. He just didn't know it.
Ses03F_impro07_M000 Hey, Isabella.
Ses03F_impro07_M001 I'm all right.
Ses03F_impro07_M003 You're not pregnant or anything.
Ses03F_impro07_M004 I know you've been trying to have a baby, right?
Ses03F_impro07_M008 Which one?
Ses03F_impro07_M011 Good for you.
Ses03F_impro07_M012 oh yeah.
Ses03F_impro07_M013 Oh, Jesus. That is so amazing.
Ses03F_impro07_M014 Party. You want to get drunk tonight?
Ses03F_impro07_M015 Yeah, we're going to celebrate.
Ses03F_impro07_M019 Who-whooooo. Miss Acti- Acting Pants.
Ses03F_impro07_M021 I got into film school at the Art Academy.
Ses03F_impro07_M022 So I'm going to be--yeah. I'm going to make films; you're going to be in them.
Ses03F_impro07_M023 Fuck Boston.
Ses03F_impro07_M025 We should uh- go to Little Ethiopia.
Ses03F_impro07_M026 Hell, yeah. Pass out.
Ses03F_impro07_M027 -drunk.
Ses03F_impro07_M028 No, I'll sleep in your bed. Cuddle up.
Ses03F_impro07_M029 Uh-oh.
Ses03F_impro07_M032 Yeah.
Ses03F_impro07_M033 Well, get used to it.
Ses03F_impro07_M034 Hey, I'm already getting used to it.
Ses03F_impro07_M035 Me too, Isabella.
Ses03F_impro08_M000 Hey, you stupid dumb shit machine, give me a fucking operator, huh?
Ses03F_impro08_M006 You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.
Ses03F_impro08_M007 -have to, have to what?
Ses03F_impro08_M008 What?  It's my phone.  You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.
Ses03F_impro08_M009 What?  Are you kidding me?
Ses03F_impro08_M010 Oh, my God.
Ses03F_impro08_M011 I- I'm going to kill myself right now.
Ses03F_impro08_M012 A free calling card?
Ses03F_impro08_M014 That's it? Okay, yeah.  What else?
Ses03F_impro08_M015 Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?
Ses03F_impro08_M021 About three million dollars.
Ses03F_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M001 He was out there when it happened.
Ses03F_script01_1_M002 Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.
Ses03F_script01_1_M003 I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03F_script01_1_M004 No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.
Ses03F_script01_1_M005 I could hear it right through the floor.
Ses03F_script01_1_M006 I guess he is.
Ses03F_script01_1_M007 I don't know.
Ses03F_script01_1_M008 But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses03F_script01_1_M009 Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
Ses03F_script01_1_M016 You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?
Ses03F_script01_1_M017 You know.
Ses03F_script01_1_M018 I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03F_script01_1_M020 So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.
Ses03F_script01_1_M021 See, then it's not just my business. God, you have
Ses03F_script01_1_M022 -Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.
Ses03F_script01_1_M026 Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.
Ses03F_script01_1_M027 To hell with that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M028 I didn't ask Annie yet.
Ses03F_script01_1_M029 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03F_script01_1_M030 Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.
Ses03F_script01_1_M031 I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?
Ses03F_script01_1_M034 Because it is.
Ses03F_script01_1_M036 It just is. I-
Ses03F_script01_1_M041 But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.
Ses03F_script01_1_M042 I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.
Ses03F_script01_1_M045 Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03F_script01_1_M046 Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M047 Now, where do I find it?
Ses03F_script01_1_M048 Yes. On this I would.
Ses03F_script01_1_M049 Then help me stay here.
Ses03F_script01_1_M050 Okay. Just-
Ses03F_script01_1_M052 I am thinking like that.
Ses03F_script01_1_M053 No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses03F_script01_2_M001 Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses03F_script01_2_M003 How do you know he's even thinking about it?
Ses03F_script01_2_M004 Well, so what?
Ses03F_script01_2_M006 You can't read her mind.
Ses03F_script01_2_M007 How do you know why she's waited?
Ses03F_script01_2_M008 Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?
Ses03F_script01_2_M009 Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_M011 All right. All right. Calm yourself.
Ses03F_script01_2_M013 Why me, above all?
Ses03F_script01_2_M014 Huh?
Ses03F_script01_2_M015 Why me above all?
Ses03F_script01_2_M016 Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses03F_script01_2_M017 What have I got to hide?
Ses03F_script01_2_M018 Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?
Ses03F_script01_3_M000 Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?
Ses03F_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses03F_script01_3_M003 Well-
Ses03F_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses03F_script01_3_M006 Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.
Ses03F_script01_3_M009 I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.
Ses03F_script01_3_M010 Oh, Annie.
Ses03F_script01_3_M011 Annie, I love you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M012 I love you a great deal.
Ses03F_script01_3_M013 I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M014 I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.
Ses03F_script01_3_M015 I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.
Ses03F_script01_3_M018 You felt something that far back?
Ses03F_script01_3_M019 Why didn't you let me know?
Ses03F_script01_3_M020 Give me a kiss, Annie.
Ses03F_script01_3_M021 Give me-
Ses03F_script01_3_M023 We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03F_script01_3_M024 I kissed you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M025 Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M026 No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.
Ses03F_script01_3_M027 Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.
Ses03F_script01_3_M028 I don't know where to start.
Ses03F_script01_3_M029 You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.
Ses03F_script01_3_M030 Well, I lost them.
Ses03F_script01_3_M031 Just about all.
Ses03F_script01_3_M032 It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.
Ses03F_script01_3_M033 For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.
Ses03F_script01_3_M034 I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.
Ses03F_script01_3_M035 And I, and I thought something watching them go down.
Ses03F_script01_3_M036 Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?
Ses03F_script01_3_M037 And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03F_script01_3_M038 And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.
Ses03F_script01_3_M039 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.
Ses03F_script01_3_M040 And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.
Ses03F_script01_3_M041 Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M042 And I didn't want to take any of it.
Ses03F_script01_3_M043 And I guess that included you.
Ses03F_script01_3_M045 Annie,
Ses03F_script01_3_M046 Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses03F_script02_1_M000 Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?
Ses03F_script02_1_M001 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
Ses03F_script02_1_M002 You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?
Ses03F_script02_1_M003 Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.
Ses03F_script02_1_M004 Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?
Ses03F_script02_1_M005 Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.
Ses03F_script02_1_M006 Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?
Ses03F_script02_1_M009 We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
Ses03F_script02_1_M010 I hope the moon stays out.
Ses03F_script02_1_M011 Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?
Ses03F_script02_1_M013 We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.
Ses03F_script02_1_M014 You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.
Ses03F_script02_1_M015 I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
Ses03F_script02_1_M016 I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
Ses03F_script02_1_M017 Do you want my jacket?
Ses03F_script02_1_M019 Right.
Ses03F_script02_1_M020 Yeah, that's my point too.
Ses03F_script02_1_M021 No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.
Ses03F_script02_1_M022 I mean, don't you want to see it?
Ses03F_script02_1_M023 Why not?
Ses03F_script02_1_M036 I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
Ses03F_script02_1_M038 And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses03F_script02_1_M039 You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.
Ses03F_script02_1_M040 its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.
Ses03F_script02_1_M041 They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here
Ses03F_script02_1_M042 where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.
Ses03F_script02_1_M044 About what I just said.
Ses03F_script02_2_M001 About what I was just saying.
Ses03F_script02_2_M005 Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
Ses03F_script02_2_M008 We're not seeing the grunions?
Ses03F_script02_2_M016 Wait a minute. I got it.
Ses03F_script02_2_M026 A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?
Ses03F_script02_2_M038 Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.
Ses03F_script02_2_M039 Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.
Ses03F_script02_2_M040 Look what we got here.
Ses03F_script02_2_M041 It's not champagne.
Ses03F_script02_2_M042 Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?
Ses03F_script02_2_M043 Shh.
Ses03F_script02_2_M044 If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03F_script02_2_M045 Or not.
Ses03F_script03_1_M004 We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.
Ses03F_script03_1_M005 Then I don't care.
Ses03F_script03_1_M007 things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?
Ses03F_script03_1_M011 [LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.
Ses03F_script03_1_M013 Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.
Ses03F_script03_1_M020 Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
Ses03F_script03_1_M022 Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
Ses03F_script03_1_M027 That was a rouser, wasn't it?
Ses03F_script03_2_M000 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses03F_script03_2_M001 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
Ses03F_script03_2_M002 I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.
Ses03F_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you. You said so.
Ses03F_script03_2_M007 What about me?
Ses03F_script03_2_M008 That's a nice point of view, I must say.
Ses03F_script03_2_M009 Are you bored with this conversation?
Ses03F_script03_2_M010 So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?
Ses03F_script03_2_M011 I'll have a little, I think.
Ses03F_script03_2_M012 No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.
Ses03F_script03_2_M014 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.
Ses03F_script03_2_M015 Really, Amanda.
Ses03F_script03_2_M016 Nothing.
Ses03F_script03_2_M017 Going somewhere, dear?
Ses03F_script03_2_M020 Yes, it is.
Ses03F_script03_2_M024 They snap.
Ses03F_script03_2_M026 did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
Ses03F_script03_2_M027 I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?
Ses03F_script03_2_M028 You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.
Ses03F_script03_2_M029 I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_M030 Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.
Ses03F_script03_2_M034 Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.
Ses03F_script03_2_M035 This is no time of the year for Tunis.
Ses03F_script03_2_M038 Turn it off.
Ses03F_script03_2_M039 Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-
Ses03F_script03_2_M040 Very amusing indeed.
Ses03F_script03_2_M041 You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.
Ses03F_script03_2_M042 No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.
Ses03F_script03_2_M043 Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Ses03F_script03_2_M044 I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.
Ses03M_impro01_M004 What are you talking about?  It says fill out that part.
Ses03M_impro01_M011 I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying right here.
Ses03M_impro01_M012 Hey,uh-- Well that's too bad cause I'm getting my license right now.
Ses03M_impro01_M014 Hey, no, give me that back.
Ses03M_impro01_M015 -- No.  I'm not waiting...I'm not coming back again.  I don't have time to come back five days.

Ses03M_impro01_M023 No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here-- I am filling out right now okay just calm down. I'm filling out right now-- Just take the god damn piece of paper.
Ses03M_impro01_M028 I did finish one.  Take it.
Ses03M_impro01_M029 What is wrong with you?
Ses03M_impro02_M000 Hey sweetie.
Ses03M_impro02_M001 Hey.
Ses03M_impro02_M002 Uh, -Um
Ses03M_impro02_M003 they need me out there sooner than I thought
Ses03M_impro02_M004 They want to deploy me next week.
Ses03M_impro02_M005 For--
Ses03M_impro02_M006 They said anywhere from two to three years.
Ses03M_impro02_M011 No.
Ses03M_impro02_M012 Honey you're not going to be by yourself--
Ses03M_impro02_M013 We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything.  My whole family's here too.
Ses03M_impro02_M015 You can do it.  Alright?  You can, you can be strong, you can be strong for both of us alright?
Ses03M_impro02_M016 I don't know what to do.
Ses03M_impro02_M019 You know I can't say no.
Ses03M_impro02_M024 Honey after a year I can be back.
Ses03M_impro02_M025 They want me there two years but I could probably get
Ses03M_impro02_M026 maybe get some vacation-- --once it quiets down there.
Ses03M_impro02_M027 I know.  I know.  But they really need some good guys there.
Ses03M_impro02_M028 Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.
Ses03M_impro02_M029 It's just going to be--it's going to go faster than you think.
Ses03M_impro02_M030 You tell her-- [BREATHING]
Ses03M_impro02_M031 What do you mean?
Ses03M_impro03_M000 Hey.
Ses03M_impro03_M001 Esmeralda, guess what?
Ses03M_impro03_M002 [LAUGHTER] Guess who just got hitched?

Ses03M_impro03_M004 Okay we were at Chuck E. Cheese.
Ses03M_impro03_M011 Ah...Anyways, so she took the ring and she goes, is this real?  So I was like, of course--
Ses03M_impro03_M012 Sara and I--
Ses03M_impro03_M013 Come on. It was her birthday.
Ses03M_impro03_M014 She wanted...she always wants something spontaneous.
Ses03M_impro03_M015 I couldn't, I couldn't afford the Red Lobster. [LAUGHTER] What anyway?
Ses03M_impro03_M016 So Okay then and.
Ses03M_impro03_M017 I got all the character animals to do a conga line,
Ses03M_impro03_M018 dim down the lights and uh, I got on one of the tables pulled her up.

Ses03M_impro03_M035 I'm so excited.  It's going to be great.
Ses03M_impro03_M038 I'm still working at my parents' restaurant. Busing tables.
Ses03M_impro03_M039 Oh that's great. My mom said we can move in with her again if we run out of money.
Ses03M_impro04_M000 I'm just so tired all the time.
Ses03M_impro04_M004 Cause I went to Harvard.
Ses03M_impro04_M008 I'm smarter than half the people I work for.
Ses03M_impro04_M014 Oh yeah?  What kind of jobs they got?
Ses03M_impro04_M024 Yeah.  It's alright.  But--
Ses03M_impro04_M026 No.
Ses03M_impro04_M030 Maybe I'll just kill myself.
Ses03M_impro04_M031 I was just joking...
Ses03M_impro04_M038 Same difference.
Ses03M_impro04_M041 Like, wow you're really smart we're going to give you an extra [GARBAGE].

Ses03M_impro05a_M013 It's my mother's funeral tomorrow and the urn is in the suitcase.
Ses03M_impro05a_M014 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro05a_M016 Oh, oh, that's a good deduction.
Ses03M_impro05a_M017 Sherlock Holmes.  God, where's my luggage?
Ses03M_impro05a_M018 Calm down?  It's my mother's funeral tomorrow.  I'm the one responsible for this.

Ses03M_impro05b_M014 Okay, so you can put me in Holiday Inn for twenty dollar a night?
Ses03M_impro05b_M015 Of course I had my name tags on the luggage.
Ses03M_impro05b_M016 Soon as you...that's not good enough okay?
Ses03M_impro05b_M019 I work for IBM.
Ses03M_impro05b_M020 You misplace a lot of, eight pieces of luggage.
Ses03M_impro05b_M021 Are you kidding me?
Ses03M_impro05b_M022 Who are you going to fire because of that?
Ses03M_impro05b_M023 Wow.  This has never happened before.  I've not lost,
Ses03M_impro05b_M024 in all thousand flights I've been on probably I can't even count how many flights I've been on.  This has never happened before.
Ses03M_impro05b_M025 This is the worst customer service I've ever gotten before.
Ses03M_impro05b_M026 Okay.  Get on the phone and figure out where my luggage is and tell me when it's going to get there alright?
Ses03M_impro05b_M027 And and, in about...

Ses03M_impro05b_M031 Some peanuts?  Wow.  That helps a lot.
Ses03M_impro05b_M032 Thanks you, thank you I don't have my luggage so you gave me a Holiday Inn stay and peanuts.  Wow.  You know what?
Ses03M_impro05b_M033 I will never do business with Delta again.
Ses03M_impro06_M000 I ah--
Ses03M_impro06_M001 alright.
Ses03M_impro06_M002 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro06_M003 It just feels like I was talking to him yesterday.
Ses03M_impro06_M004 He was my only friend growing up.
Ses03M_impro06_M005 no one else would talk to me but he would.
Ses03M_impro06_M006 He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.
Ses03M_impro06_M007 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro06_M008 You know I was always the one to tell him to be more wild you know?
Ses03M_impro06_M009 And he just took it overboard.
Ses03M_impro06_M010 You know a stupid case of drunk driving it's just...
Ses03M_impro06_M011 and the worst part of it is that he was in the car with his girlfriend,
Ses03M_impro06_M012 his girlfriend got killed too.
Ses03M_impro06_M013 And the car that he hit was his family.
Ses03M_impro06_M014 The mother and father died--
Ses03M_impro06_M015 and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now.
Ses03M_impro06_M016 and just going to the funeral it's-
Ses03M_impro06_M017 -do I miss him or do I hate him, you know?
Ses03M_impro06_M018 I was supposed to see him last summer
Ses03M_impro06_M019 then I got busy with work and stuff and three years go by
Ses03M_impro06_M020 and then something like this happens you know?
Ses03M_impro06_M021 I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months.
Ses03M_impro06_M022 He's supposed to be my best friend.
Ses03M_impro06_M023 It's so fucked up.
Ses03M_impro06_M024 Why is that?
Ses03M_impro06_M025 He was studying to be a doctor.
Ses03M_impro06_M026 I mean he was...he wanted to help people in poor countries, that is his goal.  He didn't care about the money.  He just wanted to go and help people.
Ses03M_impro06_M027 What the...what am I doing?
Ses03M_impro06_M028 Working for corporate America?  Wow.
Ses03M_impro06_M029 He actually wanted to do something.
Ses03M_impro06_M030 I can't do that.
Ses03M_impro06_M031 You should've met him.
Ses03M_impro06_M032 He is the greatest...everyone liked him.
Ses03M_impro07_M002 Guess who got into U.S.C.?
Ses03M_impro07_M003 Me. Yeah, I did.
Ses03M_impro07_M004 Yeah.

Ses03M_impro07_M006 I got into cinema production.
Ses03M_impro07_M007 Yeah.
Ses03M_impro07_M008 No.  It's like it's harder than getting into Harvard.
Ses03M_impro07_M009 What does that mean?
Ses03M_impro07_M010 Holy shit...
Ses03M_impro07_M011 This will be like high school but even better.
Ses03M_impro07_M013 I have some bad news.  I was like what?  She's like not really you got into U.S.C. and I was like, I was like oh my God.  I was about to tear my own hair out.
Ses03M_impro07_M014 Yeah.  This is so crazy.  I mean I didn't get into any other school but I got into the school I wanted.
Ses03M_impro07_M015 Oh my God the first minute I got it I sent it back in.
Ses03M_impro07_M016 So...
Ses03M_impro07_M017 This is so exciting.  This is like a new chapter in our lives.
Ses03M_impro07_M018 We're doing what we want to do, then four years later we're going to be working professionals, making money, sipping martinis every day.
Ses03M_impro07_M019 Thank you
Ses03M_impro07_M020 And tonight my parents want to take me out to sushi and they said I could bring you.

Ses03M_impro07_M025 It took them, oh man, it took them like, I mean what it's like April now and any letters that come in April are usually the rejection letters so I was just like...

Ses03M_impro08a_M005 So what exactly is the problem?

Ses03M_impro08a_M007 I understand--we're not-
Ses03M_impro08a_M008 No.  Okay.  We're not charging you for any of these months.  We're going to give you three months free.

Ses03M_impro08b_M007 Well, um- okay.  Your sim card is in- didn't fall out-
Ses03M_impro08b_M008 Alright.  Um- Well that could be the problem. cause--
Ses03M_impro08b_M009 you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.

Ses03M_impro08b_M011 So we'll send it- And we'll give you, how about a free year's service?

Ses03M_impro08b_M022 Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.
Ses03M_script01_1_M000 He saw it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M001 He was out there when it happened.
Ses03M_script01_1_M002 About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
Ses03M_script01_1_M003 I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.
Ses03M_script01_1_M004 No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.
Ses03M_script01_1_M005 I could hear it right through the floor.
Ses03M_script01_1_M006 I guess he is.
Ses03M_script01_1_M007 I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.
Ses03M_script01_1_M009 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.
Ses03M_script01_1_M011 Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?
Ses03M_script01_1_M012 That we haven't had any hope for years now?
Ses03M_script01_1_M017 You know why I asked Annie here, right?
Ses03M_script01_1_M019 I want to ask her to marry me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M021 Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M022 Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.
Ses03M_script01_1_M027 Well to hell with that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M028 I wanted to get this settled first.
Ses03M_script01_1_M029 Then I guess that's the end of it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M030 But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
Ses03M_script01_1_M031 And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M036 I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
Ses03M_script01_1_M037 But if I can't have that here I'll get out.
Ses03M_script01_1_M038 I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.
Ses03M_script01_1_M039 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.
Ses03M_script01_1_M040 The business doesn't inspire me.
Ses03M_script01_1_M041 Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.
Ses03M_script01_1_M043 Yes.  On this I would.
Ses03M_script01_1_M045 I know.  Just you help me stay here.
Ses03M_script01_1_M046 I am thinking like that.
Ses03M_script01_1_M047 No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses03M_script01_2_M001 Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.
Ses03M_script01_2_M004 Who said he even thought about that?
Ses03M_script01_2_M005 Well, so what?
Ses03M_script01_2_M008 How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?
Ses03M_script01_2_M014 Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?
Ses03M_script01_2_M015 Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?
Ses03M_script01_2_M016 Look at you, you're shaking.
Ses03M_script01_2_M017 What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?
Ses03M_script01_3_M001 You're not sorry you came?
Ses03M_script01_3_M004 What?
Ses03M_script01_3_M008 I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.
Ses03M_script01_3_M010 I love you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M016 You felt something that far back.
Ses03M_script01_3_M018 Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...
Ses03M_script01_3_M019 Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.
Ses03M_script01_3_M021 We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
Ses03M_script01_3_M023 Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M027 You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
Ses03M_script01_3_M028 Well I lost them.
Ses03M_script01_3_M029 Just about all.
Ses03M_script01_3_M030 Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.
Ses03M_script01_3_M031 For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.
Ses03M_script01_3_M032 That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.
Ses03M_script01_3_M033 A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.
Ses03M_script01_3_M034 It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?
Ses03M_script01_3_M035 And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
Ses03M_script01_3_M036 And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.
Ses03M_script01_3_M037 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.
Ses03M_script01_3_M038 It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,
Ses03M_script01_3_M039 open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
Ses03M_script01_3_M040 cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.
Ses03M_script01_3_M041 Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.
Ses03M_script01_3_M042 And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M045 Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
Ses03M_script01_3_M046 Buy some hats?
Ses03M_script02_1_M000 Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?
Ses03M_script02_1_M001 Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.
Ses03M_script02_1_M002 You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?
Ses03M_script02_1_M003 Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.
Ses03M_script02_1_M004 But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?
Ses03M_script02_1_M005 Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.
Ses03M_script02_1_M014 God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.
Ses03M_script02_1_M015 I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]
Ses03M_script02_1_M016 I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
Ses03M_script02_1_M017 Do you want my jacket?
Ses03M_script02_1_M023 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.
Ses03M_script02_1_M024 Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.
Ses03M_script02_1_M025 But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.
Ses03M_script02_1_M026 Yeah they do.
Ses03M_script02_1_M027 Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.
Ses03M_script02_1_M034 Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?
Ses03M_script02_1_M035 You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.
Ses03M_script02_1_M036 I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
Ses03M_script02_1_M037 Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...
Ses03M_script02_1_M038 ...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
Ses03M_script02_1_M039 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.
Ses03M_script02_1_M040 They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
Ses03M_script02_1_M041 Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.
Ses03M_script02_1_M042 [BREATHING] So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_1_M043 About what I just said?
Ses03M_script02_2_M000 So what do you think?
Ses03M_script02_2_M014 Well, we're going to see it.
Ses03M_script02_2_M017 Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.
Ses03M_script02_2_M019 Wait a minute.  I've got it.
Ses03M_script02_2_M020 It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...
Ses03M_script02_2_M021 And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.
Ses03M_script02_2_M022 You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?
Ses03M_script02_2_M028 Welcome to the human race.
Ses03M_script02_2_M029 Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.
Ses03M_script02_2_M030 I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...
Ses03M_script02_2_M031 ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.
Ses03M_script02_2_M032 Yes it is.
Ses03M_script02_2_M033 Right.
Ses03M_script02_2_M036 Maybe if you were with someone else too.
Ses03M_script02_2_M037 I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
Ses03M_script02_2_M041 I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.
Ses03M_script02_2_M042 Hey, look what we got here.
Ses03M_script02_2_M045 Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
Ses03M_script02_2_M046 Or not.
Ses03M_script03_1_M004 I don't care then.
Ses03M_script03_1_M006 No, wrong number.
Ses03M_script03_1_M035 I didn't hit you very hard.
Ses03M_script03_2_M000 Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_M003 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
Ses03M_script03_2_M004 You must admit he was in love with you.
Ses03M_script03_2_M005 You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?
Ses03M_script03_2_M006 And what about me?
Ses03M_script03_2_M007 Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.
Ses03M_script03_2_M008 Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.
Ses03M_script03_2_M009 You want some brandy?
Ses03M_script03_2_M010 I'll have a little I think.
Ses03M_script03_2_M011 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
Ses03M_script03_2_M012 Oh my...just because I just...okay...
Ses03M_script03_2_M014 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
Ses03M_script03_2_M019 Actually that's perfectly true.
Ses03M_script03_2_M020 Yes it is.
Ses03M_script03_2_M021 I think that
Ses03M_script03_2_M029 I'm not in the least bit drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_M030 Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.
Ses03M_script03_2_M031 Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?
Ses03M_script03_2_M032 We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.
Ses03M_script03_2_M033 Oh, thanks.  I think I will.
Ses03M_script03_2_M034 You better turn that off.
Ses03M_script03_2_M038 No I'll do no such thing.
Ses03M_script03_2_M039 Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
Ses03M_script03_2_M040 Turn it--Turn it off.
Ses03M_script03_2_M041 Very amusing indeed.
Ses03M_script03_2_M042 You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.
Ses03M_script03_2_M043 You're not going nowhere. No you're not.
Ses03M_script03_2_M044 Just shut up.
Ses03M_script03_2_M045 shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.
Ses03M_script03_2_M046 Oh.
Ses04F_impro01_F004 I did exactly what they told me to do.
Ses04F_impro01_F008 I've been to the back of the line five times.
Ses04F_impro01_F009 Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?
Ses04F_impro01_F010 Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.
Ses04F_impro01_F012 I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.
Ses04F_impro01_F014 I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.
Ses04F_impro01_F016 This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.
Ses04F_impro01_F019 I'm testing your patience?
Ses04F_impro01_F021 I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.
Ses04F_impro01_F022 Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please.
Ses04F_impro02_F000 Yeah.  They just called.
Ses04F_impro02_F001 I know.
Ses04F_impro02_F002 I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.
Ses04F_impro02_F003 I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.
Ses04F_impro02_F005 Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.
Ses04F_impro02_F006 Do you think I want to leave you?
Ses04F_impro02_F007 I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?
Ses04F_impro02_F009 And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.
Ses04F_impro02_F011 What's that supposed to mean?
Ses04F_impro02_F012 Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?
Ses04F_impro02_F017 Thanks that helps.
Ses04F_impro02_F018 I feel much better now.
Ses04F_impro02_F022 That's how you want to leave it?
Ses04F_impro02_F023 I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.
Ses04F_impro02_F024 Fine.
Ses04F_impro03_F000 I have something to tell you.
Ses04F_impro03_F001 It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?
Ses04F_impro03_F002 Look.
Ses04F_impro03_F003 Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.
Ses04F_impro03_F004 I know. I'm so-
Ses04F_impro03_F005 Thank you. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro03_F006 You think. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro03_F007 Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.
Ses04F_impro03_F009 We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro03_F010 Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff.
Ses04F_impro03_F011 So pretty.
Ses04F_impro03_F012 Very Midsummer Night's wedding.
Ses04F_impro03_F013 Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.
Ses04F_impro03_F014 Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help
Ses04F_impro03_F015 plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.
Ses04F_impro03_F016 Yeah?
Ses04F_impro03_F017 Really?
Ses04F_impro03_F018 Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time.
Ses04F_impro03_F034 Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.
Ses04F_impro03_F036 Yes.
Ses04F_impro03_F038 because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.
Ses04F_impro03_F040 Ha ha ha.
Ses04F_impro03_F041 Ha ha.
Ses04F_impro03_F042 Just couldn't be any cooler.
Ses04F_impro03_F043 I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.
Ses04F_impro03_F044 You don't look like you're going to faint.
Ses04F_impro03_F045 So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?
Ses04F_impro03_F047 You haven't ruined it yet.
Ses04F_impro03_F048 You really like
Ses04F_impro03_F050 You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.
Ses04F_impro03_F051 [LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.
Ses04F_impro03_F052 [laughter]
Ses04F_impro04_F000 That's helpful.
Ses04F_impro04_F005 I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.
Ses04F_impro04_F006 What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.
Ses04F_impro04_F008 Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.
Ses04F_impro04_F011 Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_F013 I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.
Ses04F_impro04_F014 I mean it's not like this is an
Ses04F_impro04_F015 extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.
Ses04F_impro04_F016 Okay. Okay, Fine.
Ses04F_impro04_F017 Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?
Ses04F_impro04_F018 I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-
Ses04F_impro04_F025 Well you- just you're doing something wrong.
Ses04F_impro04_F030 What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.
Ses04F_impro04_F031 I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.
Ses04F_impro05_F004 Lost it just, like, I mean,
Ses04F_impro05_F005 it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention
Ses04F_impro05_F006 because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.
Ses04F_impro05_F008 No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.
Ses04F_impro05_F009 You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.
Ses04F_impro05_F010 Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.
Ses04F_impro05_F011 Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.
Ses04F_impro05_F012 I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.
Ses04F_impro05_F013 I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-
Ses04F_impro05_F014 You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.
Ses04F_impro05_F015 No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.
Ses04F_impro05_F016 I want to talk to your supervisor.
Ses04F_impro05_F017 I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.
Ses04F_impro05_F018 Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?
Ses04F_impro05_F019 Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.
Ses04F_impro06_F000 Thanks.
Ses04F_impro06_F001 You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.
Ses04F_impro06_F002 I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?
Ses04F_impro06_F003 Yeah. I know. I know.
Ses04F_impro06_F004 Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-
Ses04F_impro06_F005 He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.
Ses04F_impro06_F006 It just doesn't seem fair.
Ses04F_impro06_F007 Thank you for being here.
Ses04F_impro06_F008 [LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.
Ses04F_impro06_F009 And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro06_F010 Yeah, I know.
Ses04F_impro07_F000 Guess what came today?
Ses04F_impro07_F001 My acceptance letter.
Ses04F_impro07_F002 From U.S.C..
Ses04F_impro07_F003 Yes, I am.
Ses04F_impro07_F004 Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F005 Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C..
Ses04F_impro07_F006 I know. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F007 [LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No.
Ses04F_impro07_F008 [LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.
Ses04F_impro07_F009 The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.
Ses04F_impro07_F010 Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?
Ses04F_impro07_F011 There we go.  Perfect.
Ses04F_impro07_F012 And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.
Ses04F_impro07_F013 I don't want any of those little puny ones.
Ses04F_impro07_F014 Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.
Ses04F_impro07_F015 U.S.C. has a major in that, right.
Ses04F_impro07_F016 They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.
Ses04F_impro07_F017 Okay.  Well I'm lying but-
Ses04F_impro07_F018 Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out.
Ses04F_impro07_F021 okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F022 And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.
Ses04F_impro07_F024 So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-
Ses04F_impro07_F027 Everything worked out perfectly.
Ses04F_impro07_F028 I know.  We should have a party.
Ses04F_impro07_F029 An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.
Ses04F_impro07_F030 No.  An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F031 Right.  Now you're with me.
Ses04F_impro07_F032 That is why I got accepted.
Ses04F_impro07_F033 I know.
Ses04F_impro07_F035 What- what did you have in mind?
Ses04F_impro07_F036 [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F038 On occasion I've heard of it.
Ses04F_impro07_F039 Yeah.  Totally.
Ses04F_impro07_F040 I am totally down with the ice cream.
Ses04F_impro07_F041 Eh, we can work that part out.
Ses04F_impro07_F042 Alright.
Ses04F_impro07_F044 party.
Ses04F_impro07_F047 I know.
Ses04F_impro07_F048 Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.
Ses04F_impro07_F049 Well no.  I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job
Ses04F_impro07_F050 while I'm in school.  It'll be good.
Ses04F_impro07_F051 Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.
Ses04F_impro07_F052 I know.  Right down the street.
Ses04F_impro07_F058 Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.
Ses04F_impro07_F059 Okay.  No, that's dorky.
Ses04F_impro07_F060 Yeah.
Ses04F_impro07_F061 Student counsel?
Ses04F_impro07_F062 No, it's dorky.
Ses04F_impro07_F063 Social life.  Hello.
Ses04F_impro07_F064 [LAUGHTER].
Ses04F_impro07_F065 [LAUGHTER].
Ses04F_impro07_F066 No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the
Ses04F_impro07_F070 What have you heard about the Greek system?
Ses04F_impro07_F074 Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.
Ses04F_impro07_F078 That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04F_impro07_F079 me.
Ses04F_impro08_F000 Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?
Ses04F_impro08_F001 Okay.  Well, Did you go through the automated menu?  Most of your requests can be taken care of through that.
Ses04F_impro08_F002 Okay.  Well I'd be happy to-
Ses04F_impro08_F004 Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there.
Ses04F_impro08_F005 Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?
Ses04F_impro08_F006 Can you be a little more specific, sir?
Ses04F_impro08_F008 Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?
Ses04F_impro08_F009 Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address.
Ses04F_impro08_F023 But I'm giving you what you want.
Ses04F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses04F_script01_1_F011 What do you want to do, argue with him?
Ses04F_script01_1_F012 You can't say that to him.
Ses04F_script01_1_F013 How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses04F_script01_1_F014 To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?
Ses04F_script01_1_F015 The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.
Ses04F_script01_1_F018 Well that's only your business, Chris.
Ses04F_script01_1_F019 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses04F_script01_1_F022 I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses04F_script01_1_F023 From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.
Ses04F_script01_1_F024 Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?
Ses04F_script01_1_F025 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
Ses04F_script01_1_F029 I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses04F_script01_1_F030 Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
Ses04F_script01_1_F032 You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?
Ses04F_script01_1_F035 Are you crazy?
Ses04F_script01_1_F036 You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses04F_script01_1_F037 Must you be inspired?
Ses04F_script01_1_F040 Alright but don't think that way
Ses04F_script01_1_F041 because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.
Ses04F_script01_1_F042 But don't think that way.  You hear me?
Ses04F_script01_1_F044 Yeah.  I can see that.
Ses04F_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her?
Ses04F_script01_2_F001 It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?
Ses04F_script01_2_F005 What's going on here, Joe?
Ses04F_script01_2_F006 No, line.
Ses04F_script01_2_F007 She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.
Ses04F_script01_2_F008 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?
Ses04F_script01_2_F009 Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.
Ses04F_script01_2_F010 Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.
Ses04F_script01_2_F016 She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-
Ses04F_script01_3_F009 I guess this is why I came.
Ses04F_script01_3_F010 Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.
Ses04F_script01_3_F012 You started to write me.
Ses04F_script01_3_F013 Every day since.
Ses04F_script01_3_F014 I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.
Ses04F_script01_3_F015 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses04F_script01_3_F023 Yeah, sure.
Ses04F_script01_3_F024 How many?
Ses04F_script01_3_F030 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses04F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses04F_script02_1_F007 It's after eleven let's go home.
Ses04F_script02_1_F008 There is no point in coming down here.
Ses04F_script02_1_F012 I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses04F_script02_1_F013 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.
Ses04F_script02_1_F014 What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
Ses04F_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses04F_script02_1_F017 Yes.
Ses04F_script02_1_F019 We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses04F_script02_1_F021 About what?
Ses04F_script02_1_F022 It's ridiculous.
Ses04F_script02_2_F002 It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
Ses04F_script02_2_F005 Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses04F_script02_2_F006 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses04F_script02_2_F007 For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.
Ses04F_script02_2_F008 We totally skipped. Right.
Ses04F_script02_2_F009 For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.
Ses04F_script02_2_F010 We never do.  Do we have we ever?
Ses04F_script02_2_F011 Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.
Ses04F_script02_2_F014 and the fish won't show up.
Ses04F_script02_2_F019 We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes
Ses04F_script02_2_F020 and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me
Ses04F_script02_2_F021 right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses04F_script02_2_F022 And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
Ses04F_script02_2_F023 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses04F_script02_2_F024 I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
Ses04F_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses04F_script02_2_F026 No.
Ses04F_script02_2_F031 No.
Ses04F_script02_2_F033 This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses04F_script02_2_F034 Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses04F_script02_2_F037 I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses04F_script02_2_F041 somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
Ses04F_script02_2_F043 Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.
Ses04F_script02_2_F044 Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.
Ses04F_script02_2_F045 Well then I guess we don't need glasses.
Ses04F_script02_2_F046 I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.
Ses04F_script03_1_F005 Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.
Ses04F_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses04F_script03_1_F007 Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
Ses04F_script03_1_F009 It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
Ses04F_script03_1_F011 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses04F_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses04F_script03_1_F014 Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?
Ses04F_script03_1_F017 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?
Ses04F_script03_1_F021 Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
Ses04F_script03_1_F022 Which particular one?
Ses04F_script03_1_F023 Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses04F_script03_1_F024 Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses04F_script03_1_F026 It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses04F_script03_1_F028 Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses04F_script03_1_F029 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04F_script03_1_F030 And very much sillier.
Ses04F_script03_2_F005 What of it?
Ses04F_script03_2_F012 It's become a habit with you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F013 Oh, don't be so stupid.
Ses04F_script03_2_F014 What?
Ses04F_script03_2_F019 It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F020 Adders don't snap they sting.
Ses04F_script03_2_F021 They sting.
Ses04F_script03_2_F022 I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
Ses04F_script03_2_F023 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses04F_script03_2_F024 Mind your own business.
Ses04F_script03_2_F025 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
Ses04F_script03_2_F026 You always had a weak head.
Ses04F_script03_2_F027 On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses04F_script03_2_F028 Oh, shut up.
Ses04F_script03_2_F029 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
Ses04F_script03_2_F030 Why?
Ses04F_script03_2_F031 There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses04F_script03_2_F034 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses04F_script03_2_F035 You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses04F_script03_2_F036 Go away, go away.  I hate you.
Ses04F_script03_2_F037 Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.
Ses04F_script03_2_F038 Stop.
Ses04F_script03_2_F039 Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses04F_script03_2_F040 This is the end do you understand?  The end,
Ses04F_script03_2_F041 finally and forever
Ses04F_script03_2_F042 Oh, I am.  Let go of me.
Ses04F_script03_2_F043 Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.
Ses04F_script03_2_F044 I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.
Ses04M_impro01_F000 Okay.  What's the problem?
Ses04M_impro01_F001 Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?
Ses04M_impro01_F002 Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro01_F012 twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.
Ses04M_impro01_F018 So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.
Ses04M_impro01_F019 Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?
Ses04M_impro01_F021 Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.
Ses04M_impro02_F009 You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?
Ses04M_impro02_F020 When do you leave?
Ses04M_impro02_F021 A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.
Ses04M_impro03_F002 I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?
Ses04M_impro03_F003 [LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.
Ses04M_impro03_F004 Did she cry?
Ses04M_impro03_F005 Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?
Ses04M_impro03_F006 I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!
Ses04M_impro03_F007 Yeah, it is.
Ses04M_impro03_F008 Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_F009 Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--
Ses04M_impro03_F010 Oh, my God.
Ses04M_impro03_F011 Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.
Ses04M_impro03_F012 Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.
Ses04M_impro03_F015 It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?
Ses04M_impro03_F016 Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_F017 I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-
Ses04M_impro03_F019 It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.
Ses04M_impro03_F024 This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro03_F025 All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro04_F000 Well there has to be something you haven't tried.
Ses04M_impro04_F001 What about like a temp agency?
Ses04M_impro04_F002 Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.
Ses04M_impro04_F003 Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and
Ses04M_impro04_F004 I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.
Ses04M_impro04_F005 Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.
Ses04M_impro04_F006 Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.
Ses04M_impro04_F007 If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.
Ses04M_impro04_F008 Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.
Ses04M_impro04_F009 I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--
Ses04M_impro04_F011 It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?
Ses04M_impro04_F012 Well that sounds like your fault.
Ses04M_impro04_F013 You didn't do what I told you to do.
Ses04M_impro04_F015 I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.
Ses04M_impro04_F016 Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?
Ses04M_impro04_F017 [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro05_F000 Hi, how can I help you?
Ses04M_impro05_F001 Mmhmm.
Ses04M_impro05_F002 I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro05_F003 Right.
Ses04M_impro05_F006 Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.
Ses04M_impro05_F007 Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar
Ses04M_impro05_F008 refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes
Ses04M_impro05_F009 That's our policy, sir.
Ses04M_impro05_F010 I can't do that.
Ses04M_impro05_F013 We'll cover fifty.
Ses04M_impro05_F017 I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.
Ses04M_impro05_F019 I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-
Ses04M_impro05_F020 But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.
Ses04M_impro05_F036 I understand you're frustrated, but--
Ses04M_impro05_F037 I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.
Ses04M_impro06_F000 Hey, how you doing?
Ses04M_impro06_F001 I'm sorry.
Ses04M_impro06_F002 I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--
Ses04M_impro06_F003 I'm sorry.  It's never easy.
Ses04M_impro06_F004 But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --
Ses04M_impro06_F005 --it doesn't really do anything.  But--
Ses04M_impro06_F006 I know.  It never is.
Ses04M_impro06_F007 How's, um -- how's his parents doing?
Ses04M_impro06_F008 I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-
Ses04M_impro06_F009 Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.
Ses04M_impro06_F010 I mean, we can be grateful for that.
Ses04M_impro06_F011 You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.
Ses04M_impro06_F012 It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.
Ses04M_impro06_F014 I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.
Ses04M_impro06_F015 When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--
Ses04M_impro06_F016 Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.
Ses04M_impro06_F017 I know.
Ses04M_impro06_F018 I don't have any magic answers.  But,
Ses04M_impro06_F019 I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.
Ses04M_impro07_F002 I didn't even
Ses04M_impro07_F003 know you applied to U.S.C..
Ses04M_impro07_F004 That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?
Ses04M_impro07_F006 Right.
Ses04M_impro07_F007 Yes.
Ses04M_impro07_F008 Is U.S.C. known for its history program?
Ses04M_impro07_F009 I know.  It's a great school and you know
Ses04M_impro07_F010 It's all about the connections
Ses04M_impro07_F011 Oh, you did not just say that.
Ses04M_impro07_F012 I know.  You're going to be so close.
Ses04M_impro07_F013 I'm glad you did.
Ses04M_impro07_F014 That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here.
Ses04M_impro07_F015 Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.
Ses04M_impro07_F016 Give or take. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro07_F017 Well congratulations.
Ses04M_impro07_F018 Yeah.
Ses04M_impro07_F022 But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing.
Ses04M_impro07_F023 The -- what, the- I mean--
Ses04M_impro07_F026 Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--
Ses04M_impro07_F027 Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]
Ses04M_impro07_F036 Excuse me?
Ses04M_impro07_F037 No.
Ses04M_impro08_F020 You're just going to put it back on my account.
Ses04M_impro08_F022 Oh, my God, thank you so much.
Ses04M_impro08_F023 I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously
Ses04M_impro08_F024 make my life a lot easier.
Ses04M_impro08_F027 I'll
Ses04M_impro08_F028 call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool
Ses04M_impro08_F030 You too.
Ses04M_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
Ses04M_script01_1_F007 He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?
Ses04M_script01_1_F011 You can't say that to him.
Ses04M_script01_1_F012 How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
Ses04M_script01_1_F013 To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?
Ses04M_script01_1_F015 Why?
Ses04M_script01_1_F017 Well that's only your business, Chris.
Ses04M_script01_1_F018 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
Ses04M_script01_1_F019 Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --
Ses04M_script01_1_F021 I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
Ses04M_script01_1_F022 From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.
Ses04M_script01_1_F027 How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
Ses04M_script01_1_F028 The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses04M_script01_1_F029 I don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses04M_script01_1_F032 Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?
Ses04M_script01_1_F033 Just give it some more thought.
Ses04M_script01_1_F034 What the hell is this?
Ses04M_script01_1_F035 Are you crazy?
Ses04M_script01_1_F036 You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
Ses04M_script01_1_F037 Must you be inspired?
Ses04M_script01_1_F039 You don't want to think like that.
Ses04M_script01_1_F040 Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.
Ses04M_script01_1_F041 But don't think that way, you hear me?
Ses04M_script01_2_F000 Why did he invite her here?
Ses04M_script01_2_F001 Why does that bother you?
Ses04M_script01_2_F002 She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--
Ses04M_script01_2_F003 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses04M_script01_2_F004 He's not going to marry her.
Ses04M_script01_2_F005 It's got that about it.
Ses04M_script01_2_F006 What's going on here, Joe?
Ses04M_script01_2_F007 Now listen, kid. Now, listen.
Ses04M_script01_2_F008 She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.
Ses04M_script01_2_F009 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.
Ses04M_script01_2_F010 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.
Ses04M_script01_2_F011 Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
Ses04M_script01_2_F012 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
Ses04M_script01_2_F013 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.
Ses04M_script01_2_F014 Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?
Ses04M_script01_2_F015 She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--
Ses04M_script01_2_F016 Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone
Ses04M_script01_2_F018 You, above all, have got to believe.  You.
Ses04M_script01_2_F020 I can't help it.
Ses04M_script01_3_F012 Every day since.
Ses04M_script01_3_F013 I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.
Ses04M_script01_3_F014 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
Ses04M_script01_3_F022 How many?
Ses04M_script01_3_F023 Oh, gees.
Ses04M_script01_3_F027 What'll I do with a fortune?
Ses04M_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses04M_script02_1_F002 It's not yours.
Ses04M_script02_1_F003 It's ours.  It's mine, too.
Ses04M_script02_1_F004 You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?
Ses04M_script02_1_F005 Yes.
Ses04M_script02_1_F007 It's after eleven; let's go home.
Ses04M_script02_1_F008 There is no point in coming down here.
Ses04M_script02_1_F010 So let's go home.
Ses04M_script02_1_F012 I just don't.  It's stupid.
Ses04M_script02_1_F013 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.
Ses04M_script02_1_F014 What are you so excited about?
Ses04M_script02_1_F017 Yes.
Ses04M_script02_1_F018 Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.
Ses04M_script02_2_F000 Look at this, goose bumps.
Ses04M_script02_2_F006 Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
Ses04M_script02_2_F007 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
Ses04M_script02_2_F009 We never do, do we?  Have we ever?
Ses04M_script02_2_F013 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.
Ses04M_script02_2_F016 It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.
Ses04M_script02_2_F018 Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses04M_script02_2_F019 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
Ses04M_script02_2_F020 No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F021 No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F025 No.
Ses04M_script02_2_F026 I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
Ses04M_script02_2_F027 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses04M_script02_2_F028 Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses04M_script02_2_F029 But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
Ses04M_script02_2_F032 I didn't say that.
Ses04M_script02_2_F035 Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.
Ses04M_script02_2_F036 Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie.
Ses04M_script03_1_F005 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
Ses04M_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses04M_script03_1_F007 Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.
Ses04M_script03_1_F008 But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
Ses04M_script03_1_F009 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
Ses04M_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses04M_script03_1_F013 If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.
Ses04M_script03_1_F014 How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?
Ses04M_script03_1_F015 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
Ses04M_script03_1_F017 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?
Ses04M_script03_1_F018 Well that's serious enough, isn't it?
Ses04M_script03_1_F021 Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.
Ses04M_script03_1_F022 Which particular one?
Ses04M_script03_1_F023 Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses04M_script03_1_F024 I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses04M_script03_1_F025 It went on intermittently for days.
Ses04M_script03_1_F026 It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses04M_script03_1_F027 That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses04M_script03_1_F028 The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
Ses04M_script03_1_F029 How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04M_script03_1_F030 And very much sillier.
Ses04M_script03_2_F000 That was the first time you ever hit me.
Ses04M_script03_2_F001 The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.
Ses04M_script03_2_F002 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
Ses04M_script03_2_F003 And very much sillier.
Ses04M_script03_2_F006 Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.
Ses04M_script03_2_F008 Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.
Ses04M_script03_2_F009 Let him kiss you.
Ses04M_script03_2_F010 What of it?
Ses04M_script03_2_F014 No, thanks.
Ses04M_script03_2_F017 It's become a habit with you.
Ses04M_script03_2_F019 What?
Ses04M_script03_2_F022 Oh, no, it isn't.
Ses04M_script03_2_F023 Oh, be quiet.
Ses04M_script03_2_F024 It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_F026 Adders don't snap, they sting.
Ses04M_script03_2_F028 I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
Ses04M_script03_2_F029 Yes, I did, quite a lot.
Ses04M_script03_2_F030 Mind your own business.
Ses04M_script03_2_F031 You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.
Ses04M_script03_2_F032 You always had a weak head.
Ses04M_script03_2_F033 On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_F034 Oh, shut up.
Ses04M_script03_2_F035 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.
Ses04M_script03_2_F036 Why?
Ses04M_script03_2_F037 There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
Ses04M_script03_2_F039 Turn it on again, please.
Ses04M_script03_2_F040 Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
Ses04M_script03_2_F041 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
Ses04M_script03_2_F042 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses04M_script03_2_F043 We swapped. Listen.
Ses04M_script03_2_F044 Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.
Ses04M_script03_2_F045 Stop.
Ses04M_script03_2_F046 Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
Ses04M_script03_2_F047 This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.
Ses04M_script03_2_F048 Oh, yes, I am.
Ses04M_script03_2_F049 Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.
Ses04M_script03_2_F050 Marry you again? Huh.
Ses04M_script03_2_F051 Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.
Ses04M_script03_2_F052 Swine.
Ses05F_impro01_F000 Hi, I need an ID.
Ses05F_impro01_F008 So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-
Ses05F_impro01_F017 Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.
Ses05F_impro01_F018 Why not?
Ses05F_impro01_F020 Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.
Ses05F_impro02_F001 um.
Ses05F_impro02_F002 I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call--
Ses05F_impro02_F004 I got a call today,
Ses05F_impro02_F005 I'm going to need to go overseas for a while.
Ses05F_impro02_F008 I don't know "sigh".
Ses05F_impro02_F009 I know.  I know.
Ses05F_impro02_F010 I know.  Well, we'll have to figure all that out.  I mean, I think the Army's going to provide childcare and help us out with that. um.
Ses05F_impro02_F011 Iraq.
Ses05F_impro02_F012 I think infantry.  I'm not sure.
Ses05F_impro02_F021 I don't think there's anything we can do.
Ses05F_impro02_F023 I know.  I know it's not fair.
Ses05F_impro02_F024 Well, apparently nobody else can go.
Ses05F_impro02_F027 I know.
Ses05F_impro02_F028 I know.
Ses05F_impro02_F029 We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us?
Ses05F_impro02_F031 I'm going to miss their first words.
Ses05F_impro02_F032 You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.
Ses05F_impro02_F034 Yeah, as much as I can.
Ses05F_impro02_F035 "sigh" Three weeks.
Ses05F_impro02_F036 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro02_F037 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro02_F038 I love you.  I'm going to miss you so much. "sigh"
Ses05F_impro03_F000 Okay, so big news.
Ses05F_impro03_F001 I'm getting married.
Ses05F_impro03_F002 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F003 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F004 Uh-huh.
Ses05F_impro03_F005 Just a couple days ago.
Ses05F_impro03_F007 I know me neither.
Ses05F_impro03_F008 Right, I thought I would be way older too. I thought I would be I be at least thirty something.
Ses05F_impro03_F009 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F011 Sorry.
Ses05F_impro03_F020 Yeah.  Yeah, of course.
Ses05F_impro03_F027 It's so weird too, right, that like you can grow up so near somebody and never know them until you travel hundreds of miles away.
Ses05F_impro03_F028 I know
Ses05F_impro03_F029 Right, being like oh, where are you from?  The U.S.  Where in the U.S.?  Chicago.  Where in Chicago?
Ses05F_impro03_F030 Knowing the neighborhood.  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre.
Ses05F_impro03_F031 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F032 Mm-hmm.
Ses05F_impro03_F033 Yeah, she loves him.
Ses05F_impro03_F034 Yeah, she-yeah, that's my type.
Ses05F_impro03_F035 Thank you.
Ses05F_impro03_F036 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro03_F037 Yeah, we all have to hang out now.
Ses05F_impro03_F039 Sorry.
Ses05F_impro03_F040 There's still time for that.
Ses05F_impro03_F041 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro03_F042 I know. I can't believe it.
Ses05F_impro03_F043 I am very excited
Ses05F_impro03_F046 I have to think about moving now.  We're going to move in together
Ses05F_impro03_F047 I think it's a good idea to live together before you get married.
Ses05F_impro03_F048 I don't want a house, I mean just-
Ses05F_impro03_F049 L.A. apartment is fine.
Ses05F_impro03_F051 Two artists, though.  We're bound to be poor forever.
Ses05F_impro03_F053 Definitely not for a while
Ses05F_impro03_F054 yeah.
Ses05F_impro03_F055 [LAUGHTER] Good luck.
Ses05F_impro03_F056 You won't have trouble, You won't have trouble.
Ses05F_impro03_F057 You should just approach her like that.  Hey, will you bear my children?
Ses05F_impro03_F058 Yeah, totally.
Ses05F_impro03_F059 Total turn on.
Ses05F_impro03_F060 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro04_F000 Brian, I need help.
Ses05F_impro04_F008 I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.
Ses05F_impro04_F015 I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.
Ses05F_impro04_F016 Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?
Ses05F_impro04_F017 I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.
Ses05F_impro04_F019 I'm just worried.
Ses05F_impro04_F022 That's really hard to hear.
Ses05F_impro04_F023 I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.
Ses05F_impro04_F038 Well, I'd like to be a working actor.
Ses05F_impro04_F039 But um--
Ses05F_impro04_F040 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro04_F041 Bartending, catering.
Ses05F_impro04_F042 Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.
Ses05F_impro04_F043 yeah.
Ses05F_impro04_F044 Thank you.
Ses05F_impro04_F045 I will, I will.
Ses05F_impro05_F000 Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.
Ses05F_impro05_F001 Um-Seventeen. Coming from --
Ses05F_impro05_F002 It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.
Ses05F_impro05_F004 Right.
Ses05F_impro05_F005 Yeah.
Ses05F_impro05_F006 That's good.
Ses05F_impro05_F007 Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?
Ses05F_impro05_F010 Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.
Ses05F_impro05_F018 Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.
Ses05F_impro05_F019 No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?
Ses05F_impro05_F020 Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.
Ses05F_impro05_F021 Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.
Ses05F_impro05_F022 Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.
Ses05F_impro05_F023 And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.
Ses05F_impro05_F024 That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.
Ses05F_impro05_F031 I don't believe that for a second.
Ses05F_impro05_F033 What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?
Ses05F_impro05_F034 You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-
Ses05F_impro05_F041 No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.
Ses05F_impro05_F042 It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.
Ses05F_impro06_F000 A good friend of mine passed away the other day.
Ses05F_impro06_F001 Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,
Ses05F_impro06_F002 metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-
Ses05F_impro06_F003 Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.
Ses05F_impro06_F004 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F005 Kind of.
Ses05F_impro06_F006 It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.
Ses05F_impro06_F007 I just, I don't know.
Ses05F_impro06_F008 I know.
Ses05F_impro06_F009 And he could of...  He was pretty awesome
Ses05F_impro06_F010 Uh,  We grew up together.
Ses05F_impro06_F011 Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.
Ses05F_impro06_F012 I feel really bad for his family, you know.
Ses05F_impro06_F013 It must be really, really hard to lose a child.
Ses05F_impro06_F014 Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-
Ses05F_impro06_F015 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F016 I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.
Ses05F_impro06_F017 Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.
Ses05F_impro06_F018 Thank you.
Ses05F_impro06_F019 Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.
Ses05F_impro06_F020 Thanks.
Ses05F_impro06_F021 It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...
Ses05F_impro06_F022 something happens and they die and it's like-
Ses05F_impro06_F023 really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.
Ses05F_impro06_F024 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F025 yeah.
Ses05F_impro06_F026 It's hard to say good-bye.
Ses05F_impro06_F027 [BREATHING]
Ses05F_impro06_F029 yeah yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F000 So guess what.
Ses05F_impro07_F001 I got into college.
Ses05F_impro07_F002 U.S.C..
Ses05F_impro07_F003 yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F004 No.
Ses05F_impro07_F005 I'll stay in town.
Ses05F_impro07_F006 Uh- I don't know.
Ses05F_impro07_F007 Well, I don't want to, I don't want to live with my mom.
Ses05F_impro07_F008 Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live?
Ses05F_impro07_F011 Whoa, this is going to be so much fun.
Ses05F_impro07_F012 Thank you. I know, I'm really, really, really excited.
Ses05F_impro07_F013 I know they have a really, really great program for what I want to do.
Ses05F_impro07_F014 Can we for real live together?
Ses05F_impro07_F015 awesome.
Ses05F_impro07_F016 So should we get a place near campus? or-
Ses05F_impro07_F017 okay.
Ses05F_impro07_F021 It's going to be ridiculous.  It's going to be so cool.
Ses05F_impro07_F023 [LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean.
Ses05F_impro07_F024 I- I hear the same.
Ses05F_impro07_F025 I don't know how I feel about that, but-
Ses05F_impro07_F026 oh yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F027 oh yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F028 [LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure.
Ses05F_impro07_F029 Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.
Ses05F_impro07_F030 [LAUGHTER] by yourself.
Ses05F_impro07_F031 you'd be that kid
Ses05F_impro07_F032 living near campus, and not going to school.
Ses05F_impro07_F033 [LAUGHTER]
Ses05F_impro07_F034 yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F035 We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.
Ses05F_impro07_F036 Let's go tomorrow.
Ses05F_impro07_F037 yeah.
Ses05F_impro07_F038 Woo-
Ses05F_impro07_F039 exciting.
Ses05F_impro08_F000 Hi, sir.  How can I help you?
Ses05F_impro08_F001 Okay.
Ses05F_impro08_F002 [LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.
Ses05F_impro08_F003 I kwon, it is ridiculous
Ses05F_impro08_F004 yeah, I understand.
Ses05F_impro08_F005 Uh- when's when's-
Ses05F_impro08_F007 If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.
Ses05F_impro08_F008 Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?
Ses05F_impro08_F009 In the mail?
Ses05F_impro08_F010 So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?
Ses05F_impro08_F011 Okay.
Ses05F_impro08_F012 Okay.
Ses05F_impro08_F014 Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...
Ses05F_impro08_F015 if I call it up on the screen.
Ses05F_impro08_F016 So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?
Ses05F_impro08_F017 Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-
Ses05F_impro08_F018 Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-
Ses05F_impro08_F019 Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.
Ses05F_impro08_F020 You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?
Ses05F_impro08_F021 Yeah so- That --that did go through.
Ses05F_impro08_F022 Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.
Ses05F_impro08_F023 Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.
Ses05F_impro08_F024 Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.
Ses05F_impro08_F025 yeah.
Ses05F_impro08_F026 No problem.
Ses05F_impro08_F027 ahh one eight hundred three two three
Ses05F_impro08_F028 six four nine four
Ses05F_impro08_F029 You're welcome
Ses05F_impro08_F030 I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.
Ses05F_impro08_F032 Have a good day.
Ses05F_impro08_F033 bye bye
Ses05F_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
Ses05F_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses05F_script01_1_F005 He cried hard.
Ses05F_script01_1_F006 He is thinking about him again.
Ses05F_script01_1_F007 It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.
Ses05F_script01_1_F008 What's the meaning of that?
Ses05F_script01_1_F017 Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?
Ses05F_script01_1_F024 Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.
Ses05F_script01_1_F025 Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
Ses05F_script01_1_F026 Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?
Ses05F_script01_1_F027 The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have
Ses05F_script01_1_F028 Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
Ses05F_script01_1_F031 You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.
Ses05F_script01_1_F033 What the hell is this?
Ses05F_script01_1_F034 Are you crazy?
Ses05F_script01_1_F038 All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!
Ses05F_script01_2_F001 She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?
Ses05F_script01_2_F006 She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.
Ses05F_script01_2_F010 I want you to pretend like he's coming back!
Ses05F_script01_2_F011 Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.
Ses05F_script01_2_F012 Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?
Ses05F_script01_2_F014 Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.
Ses05F_script01_2_F016 You've got to believe. You've got to--
Ses05F_script01_2_F017 I can't help it!
Ses05F_script01_3_F000 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses05F_script01_3_F001 No, it's good.
Ses05F_script01_3_F002 It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses05F_script01_3_F003 No.  But I'm not going to stay.
Ses05F_script01_3_F006 Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.
Ses05F_script01_3_F008 Well, from her point of view why else would I come?
Ses05F_script01_3_F009 I guess this is why I came.
Ses05F_script01_3_F015 I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!
Ses05F_script01_3_F016 Not like that, you're not.
Ses05F_script01_3_F017 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?
Ses05F_script01_3_F020 It wouldn't work like this.
Ses05F_script01_3_F021 yeah sure.
Ses05F_script01_3_F022 how many?
Ses05F_script01_3_F023 Oh gee.
Ses05F_script01_3_F024 Do you still feel like that?
Ses05F_script01_3_F025 Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.
Ses05F_script01_3_F026 What would I do with a fortune?
Ses05F_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses05F_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses05F_script02_1_F005 yes.
Ses05F_script02_1_F007 It's after eleven, let's go home.
Ses05F_script02_1_F011 Not particularly.
Ses05F_script02_1_F012 I just don't.
Ses05F_script02_1_F015 I am just not.
Ses05F_script02_1_F016 Yes.
Ses05F_script02_2_F005 God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.
Ses05F_script02_2_F013 Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.
Ses05F_script02_2_F014 We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses05F_script02_2_F015 And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
Ses05F_script02_2_F016 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.
Ses05F_script02_2_F017 I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.
Ses05F_script02_2_F018 No.
Ses05F_script02_2_F019 No.
Ses05F_script02_2_F025 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
Ses05F_script02_2_F026 Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
Ses05F_script02_2_F027 But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.
Ses05F_script02_2_F028 I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.
Ses05F_script02_2_F029 I didn't say that.
Ses05F_script02_2_F030 For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.
Ses05F_script02_2_F032 Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.
Ses05F_script02_2_F033 Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.
Ses05F_script02_2_F034 Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.
Ses05F_script02_2_F037 No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses05F_script03_1_F005 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
Ses05F_script03_1_F006 Behave exquisitely.
Ses05F_script03_1_F007 Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.
Ses05F_script03_1_F010 The whole business is really rather ridiculous.
Ses05F_script03_1_F011 Meaning exactly that.
Ses05F_script03_1_F013 Who's they?
Ses05F_script03_1_F015 Well, what if-what happens when our love-
Ses05F_script03_1_F019 Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?
Ses05F_script03_1_F025 Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
Ses05F_script03_1_F030 And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
Ses05F_script03_1_F031 Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous
Ses05F_script03_1_F033 You knew there was nothing.
Ses05F_script03_2_F000 You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05F_script03_2_F001 Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05F_script03_2_F003 You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
Ses05F_script03_2_F004 maybe just a little, but--
Ses05F_script03_2_F005 And what of it?
Ses05F_script03_2_F006 Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.
Ses05F_script03_2_F010 I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.
Ses05F_script03_2_F011 Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.
Ses05F_script03_2_F012 It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F014 Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F018 Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F019 adder don't snap, they sting.
Ses05F_script03_2_F020 They sting.
Ses05F_script03_2_F021 I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.
Ses05F_script03_2_F022 Yes, I did quite a bit.
Ses05F_script03_2_F023 Mind your own business.
Ses05F_script03_2_F024 Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.
Ses05F_script03_2_F027 Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.
Ses05F_script03_2_F029 Why?
Ses05F_script03_2_F030 There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
Ses05F_script03_2_F031 They're away in Tunis.
Ses05F_script03_2_F032 Turn it on again.
Ses05F_script03_2_F033 Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.
Ses05F_script03_2_F034 Well, do try to control yourself darling.
Ses05F_script03_2_F035 You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.
Ses05F_script03_2_F036 I- I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F037 I hate you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F038 No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.
Ses05F_script03_2_F039 Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.
Ses05F_script03_2_F040 Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.
Ses05F_script03_2_F041 Beast; brute; cad; whore
Ses05M_impro01_F000 Can I help you?
Ses05M_impro01_F001 Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..
Ses05M_impro01_F002 Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.
Ses05M_impro01_F003 Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-
Ses05M_impro01_F004 No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --
Ses05M_impro01_F006 No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.
Ses05M_impro01_F009 I know.
Ses05M_impro01_F012 Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.
Ses05M_impro01_F021 I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.
Ses05M_impro01_F023 Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.
Ses05M_impro02_F012 What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?
Ses05M_impro02_F013 Well, they're so young.
Ses05M_impro02_F020 It's just so much.
Ses05M_impro02_F021 [GARBAGE] You have to write me everyday.
Ses05M_impro02_F023 okay.
Ses05M_impro02_F024 [GARBAGE]
Ses05M_impro03_F000 what?
Ses05M_impro03_F002 When?
Ses05M_impro03_F003 Oh, what, how- where how did you do it?
Ses05M_impro03_F004 Okay good. I I assumed.
Ses05M_impro03_F005 oh-
Ses05M_impro03_F006 uh-huh
Ses05M_impro03_F007 Oh, my God.  That's so dramatic.
Ses05M_impro03_F008 so cute.
Ses05M_impro03_F009 No, it's totally original, though.
Ses05M_impro03_F010 oh.
Ses05M_impro03_F011 Oh, Then you had a whole weekend of camping?
Ses05M_impro03_F012 Oh, right. sure [LAUGHTER]

Ses05M_impro04_F004 Right.
Ses05M_impro04_F005 Well, I mean, right now I'm just doing a little bit of everything.  And I don't- I don't think that I'm in like a profession, like career oriented place.
Ses05M_impro04_F006 No.  I'm just working in restaurants and stuff. But, I'm also trying to audition and what not.  So, it's --
Ses05M_impro04_F007 Really?
Ses05M_impro04_F008 L.A. is really hard.  I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and
Ses05M_impro04_F009 I was just going to say that's your issue. Maybe you are going in too much. No, I mean, just
Ses05M_impro04_F010 are you going into the bars every night?
Ses05M_impro04_F011 Well, I don't really know.  I don't I don't know you in like a job situation, so.
Ses05M_impro04_F012 Wow.  I don't -- I mean, do you- do you have an attitude problem when you're on the job?
Ses05M_impro04_F013 Maybe [garbage].
Ses05M_impro04_F014 Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.
Ses05M_impro04_F015 I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --
Ses05M_impro04_F016 Are you getting defensive?
Ses05M_impro04_F017 Yeah.  That might be something you want to look at.  I mean --
Ses05M_impro04_F018 Okay.
Ses05M_impro04_F019 I understand.
Ses05M_impro04_F020 Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that.
Ses05M_impro04_F021 ah.
Ses05M_impro04_F022 Not- Not selling pot, right?
Ses05M_impro04_F023 Okay so.
Ses05M_impro04_F024 Fair enough.
Ses05M_impro04_F026 Sorry.  So, let's see.  What else?  What's available? What? Um.  Hmm.
Ses05M_impro04_F027 Well, not off the top of head.  It will just take you know take a minute.  But do you have any, like, special skills?
Ses05M_impro04_F028 Well, maybe we can find you something with juggling.
Ses05M_impro04_F029 Have you checked out Craig's List and stuff?
Ses05M_impro04_F030 What if you do kids parties? oh, come on.
Ses05M_impro04_F031 Okay.  All right.
Ses05M_impro04_F032 Okay.  Well, fine. we won't- I won't argue with you about that.
Ses05M_impro04_F034 That's rough.  I'm really sorry, Ryan.
Ses05M_impro04_F035 Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?
Ses05M_impro04_F036 Okay.  Well, that's good.  Yeah, I mean, you're you're- when you're happy you're a pretty personable guy.  And I don't --I don't
Ses05M_impro04_F037 I can't see where the issue would be. so
Ses05M_impro05_F000 Hmm. Hmm.
Ses05M_impro05_F001 How long ago was that?
Ses05M_impro05_F002 Uh-Hmm.
Ses05M_impro05_F003 Um, okay.  Well, you can fly- file a claim.  Where were you coming from?
Ses05M_impro05_F004 So, within the country, though? umm
Ses05M_impro05_F005 Yeah, well the chances of it being lost forever, you know, are slight because -- -- you were in the --
Ses05M_impro05_F006 Well, I mean, you know that happens pretty often that sometimes baggage -- -- gets lost.
Ses05M_impro05_F007 yeah.
Ses05M_impro05_F008 Okay.
Ses05M_impro05_F009 Did you have insurance on your flight?
Ses05M_impro05_F010 No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra.
Ses05M_impro05_F011 well, it's something that worth
Ses05M_impro05_F012 yeah, I don't know.
Ses05M_impro05_F013 Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.
Ses05M_impro05_F014 Um, well, there's not much I can do.  I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in.
Ses05M_impro05_F015 wow.
Ses05M_impro05_F016 Wow.  Well, that's really important, obviously.  But, um --
Ses05M_impro05_F017 Uh- Actually, I don't know that that's legal. Um- it is the issue
Ses05M_impro05_F018 Yeah I mean, Your bag might have been confiscated because it's --
Ses05M_impro05_F019 -- it's a biohazard. so- um
Ses05M_impro05_F020 Yeah.  Let me just call security.
Ses05M_impro05_F021 [LAUGHTER] Okay.  Hold on.
Ses05M_impro06_F002 Oh, I'm so sorry
Ses05M_impro06_F003 Oh, my gosh.

Ses05M_impro06_F007 I'm sorry. I-
Ses05M_impro06_F008 Wow, Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that.
Ses05M_impro06_F009 Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.
Ses05M_impro06_F010 If there's anything I can do to be there for you.
Ses05M_impro07_F000 What?
Ses05M_impro07_F001 Oh, for real?
Ses05M_impro07_F003 oh,I'm so glad.

Ses05M_impro07_F005 Really? Are you doing the M.F.A. program?
Ses05M_impro07_F007 I heard it's so tough to get into.
Ses05M_impro07_F008 That's awesome.
Ses05M_impro07_F009 Yeah, that's awesome.
Ses05M_impro07_F010 No.
Ses05M_impro07_F011 Uh huh.  Yes, seriously, for years.
Ses05M_impro07_F012 I know.  I know.  I'm- I'm definitely -- I realize [LAUGHTER].
Ses05M_impro07_F013 Um- I'm gonna be studying at U.S.C., too.
Ses05M_impro07_F015 Yeah.  Totally- Well where are you going to live?
Ses05M_impro07_F016 Oh yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_F017 Good tradeoff
Ses05M_impro07_F018 I don't- I don't think it's that bad.
Ses05M_impro07_F019 yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_F020 Yeah. I think it's really also if you- if you consider yourself like, us and them, kind of thing- If you think you're part of your community then --you going to like it more
Ses05M_impro07_F021 Right, Exactly.
Ses05M_impro07_F022 Oh I'm so glad.
Ses05M_impro07_F023 So when do you know, like, where you're gonna live? and-
Ses05M_impro07_F024 Oh, wow.
Ses05M_impro07_F025 Um-
Ses05M_impro07_F026 Yeah.  I mean, I know, I know, like the- the housing surrounding the campus pretty well.
Ses05M_impro07_F027 Um- How many people do you want to live with?
Ses05M_impro07_F028 All dudes?
Ses05M_impro07_F029 Um- I think I have some friends.
Ses05M_impro07_F030 yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_F031 There's actually, a friend of mine is um- moving out of her place and her place is amazing-- And it's really cheap.
Ses05M_impro07_F032 yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_F033 Okay.
Ses05M_impro07_F035 You've got a lot- oh, awesome.
Ses05M_impro07_F036 Oh cool.
Ses05M_impro07_F037 Yeah.
Ses05M_impro07_F038 totally.
Ses05M_impro07_F039 good for you.
Ses05M_impro07_F040 the way to do it.
Ses05M_impro07_F041 Wow, are you so excited?
Ses05M_impro07_F042 You're gonna be so busy, too. You're going to have to work so hard.
Ses05M_impro07_F044 All right.  Wow.  So exciting.
Ses05M_impro07_F045 Yeah.  We'll have so much fun.
Ses05M_impro08_F005 Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.
Ses05M_impro08_F006 Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.
Ses05M_impro08_F007 Hmm. Mmm.
Ses05M_impro08_F008 yeah.
Ses05M_impro08_F009 It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.
Ses05M_impro08_F011 Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --
Ses05M_impro08_F012 Uh huh.
Ses05M_impro08_F013 All right.
Ses05M_impro08_F014 Yeah, I see that.
Ses05M_impro08_F015 Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_F016 Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_F017 Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.
Ses05M_impro08_F018 Uh huh, Okay.
Ses05M_impro08_F019 Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.
Ses05M_impro08_F022 Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.
Ses05M_impro08_F025 Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.
Ses05M_impro08_F026 Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.
Ses05M_impro08_F027 No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.
Ses05M_impro08_F028 Okay.  Thanks.
Ses05M_script01_1_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
Ses05M_script01_1_F001 When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?
Ses05M_script01_1_F004 Did you talk to him?
Ses05M_script01_1_F005 He cried hard?
Ses05M_script01_1_F014 The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.
Ses05M_script01_1_F018 Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.
Ses05M_script01_1_F021 I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.
Ses05M_script01_1_F022 From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?
Ses05M_script01_1_F023 Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that
Ses05M_script01_1_F024 Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses05M_script01_1_F025 Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?
Ses05M_script01_1_F026 Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.
Ses05M_script01_1_F032 Are you crazy?
Ses05M_script01_1_F035 All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.
Ses05M_script01_1_F036 Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F000 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F022 Have you asked Annie yet?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F023 Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F024 The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F026 Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F028 Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.
Ses05M_script01_1b_F031 Are you crazy?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F033 Must you be inspired?
Ses05M_script01_1b_F034 You don't want to think like that.
Ses05M_script01_2_F002 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
Ses05M_script01_2_F004 He's got that about it.
Ses05M_script01_2_F005 What's going on here, Joe?
Ses05M_script01_2_F015 You above all have got to believe.
Ses05M_script01_2_F017 I can't help it.
Ses05M_script01_3_F000 You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
Ses05M_script01_3_F001 It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.
Ses05M_script01_3_F003 Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.
Ses05M_script01_3_F006 I figured they would, your mother at least.
Ses05M_script01_3_F007 Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?
Ses05M_script01_3_F009 Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.
Ses05M_script01_3_F010 I almost got married two years ago.
Ses05M_script01_3_F012 Everyday since.
Ses05M_script01_3_F013 Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.
Ses05M_script01_3_F015 Not like that you're not.
Ses05M_script01_3_F016 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?
Ses05M_script01_3_F019 Even in your letters there was something ashamed.
Ses05M_script01_3_F020 You have to tell me.
Ses05M_script01_3_F021 It wouldn't work like this.
Ses05M_script01_3_F022 Yeah, sure.
Ses05M_script01_3_F023 How many?
Ses05M_script01_3_F024 Do you still feel like that?
Ses05M_script01_3_F025 Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.
Ses05M_script01_3_F027 [LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?
Ses05M_script02_1_F000 Fine.
Ses05M_script02_1_F001 What flashlight?
Ses05M_script02_1_F016 I'm just not.
Ses05M_script02_2_F000 About what?
Ses05M_script02_2_F001 It's ridiculous.
Ses05M_script02_2_F005 God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.
Ses05M_script02_2_F009 Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever
Ses05M_script02_2_F010 No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.
Ses05M_script02_2_F012 I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.
Ses05M_script02_2_F013 Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.
Ses05M_script02_2_F014 And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
Ses05M_script02_2_F015 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
Ses05M_script02_2_F016 I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.
Ses05M_script02_2_F017 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F018 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F019 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F022 No.
Ses05M_script02_2_F023 I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.
Ses05M_script02_2_F026 But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.
Ses05M_script02_2_F027 This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?
Ses05M_script02_2_F028 I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.
Ses05M_script02_2_F029 But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
Ses05M_script02_2_F030 I didn't say that.
Ses05M_script02_2_F031 For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.
Ses05M_script02_2_F032 Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.
Ses05M_script02_2_F034 Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.
Ses05M_script02_2_F037 No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.
Ses05M_script02_2_F038 Or not.
Ses05M_script03_1_F001 what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.
Ses05M_script03_1_F002 What do we do?
Ses05M_script03_1_F003 Now and always, my sweet.
Ses05M_script03_1_F004 It was bound to happen sooner or later.
Ses05M_script03_1_F005 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
Ses05M_script03_1_F011 Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
Ses05M_script03_1_F012 Who's they?
Ses05M_script03_1_F013 If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.
Ses05M_script03_1_F015 Well, will we always bicker and fight?
Ses05M_script03_1_F017 What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?
Ses05M_script03_1_F020 Elliott, worms don't pop.
Ses05M_script03_1_F024 I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
Ses05M_script03_1_F026 Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.
Ses05M_script03_1_F031 You knew there was nothing in that.
Ses05M_script03_2_F001 Only a trivial little broach.
Ses05M_script03_2_F002 Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
Ses05M_script03_2_F004 Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.
Ses05M_script03_2_F005 Well, what of it.
Ses05M_script03_2_F006 Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
Ses05M_script03_2_F009 No thanks.
Ses05M_script03_2_F012 It's becoming a habit with you.
Ses05M_script03_2_F015 Just making myself fascinating for you.
Ses05M_script03_2_F017 No, it isn't.
Ses05M_script03_2_F018 No, it it is not, be quiet.
Ses05M_script03_2_F023 Yes, I did quite a lot.
Ses05M_script03_2_F026 You always had a weak head.
Ses05M_script03_2_F028 Not- Would you shut up.
Ses05M_script03_2_F034 Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.
Ses05M_script03_2_F035 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
Ses05M_script03_2_F036 Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.
Ses05M_script03_2_F037 You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.
Ses05M_script03_2_F038 Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.
Ses05M_script03_2_F039 This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.
Ses05M_script03_2_F040 Yes, I am. Let go with me
Ses05M_script03_2_F041 You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!
Ses05M_script03_2_F042 Beast
Ses05M_script03_2_F043 Brute
Ses05M_script03_2_F044 pig
